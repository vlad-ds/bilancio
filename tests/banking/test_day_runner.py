Unit tests for the BankDealer day runner.

Tests verify the intraday structure:
- Part A: Open (carry-over from yesterday)
- Part B: Scheduled settlements (CB repay, loan repay)
- Part C: Ticket-by-ticket client flow
- Part D: Intraday scheduled items (deposit interest)
- Part E: Pre-close CB top-up
