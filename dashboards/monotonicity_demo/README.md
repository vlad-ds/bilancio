# Ring Monotonicity Explorer

Streamlit dashboard to experiment with the new monotonicity parameter in the Kalecki ring generator.

## Run

From the project root:

```bash
streamlit run dashboards/monotonicity_demo/streamlit_app.py
```

Adjust the sidebar controls to bias the payables toward descending (`1`), random (`0`), or ascending (`-1`) orderings and draw fresh samples to confirm the effect.
