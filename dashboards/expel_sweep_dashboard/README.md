# Expel-agent Sweep Streamlit Dashboard

This dashboard visualises the aggregate outputs for experiment 015 (expel-agent Kalecki ring sweep) and lets you drill into any individual run.

## Quick start

```bash
cd /Users/vladgheorghe/code/bilancio
streamlit run dashboards/expel_sweep_dashboard/streamlit_app.py
```

The app expects the sweep artifacts under `out/experiments/expel_ring_sweep/`, as generated by the existing CLI workflow.

## Features
- Filter the run registry by debt scale κ, concentration c, maturity misalignment μ, and minimum settlement share φ.
- Inspect per-run summaries including settlement ratios, liquidity gaps, defaults, and intraday peaks.
- Drill into a single run to review daily metrics, intraday replay, debtor-share tables, and key event logs (settlements and defaults).

## Notes
- Ensure Streamlit and Altair are available in your environment (they are both present in the project dev dependencies; install via `uv pip install streamlit altair` if needed).
- The dashboard reads CSV/PKL files directly; regenerate the sweep if those artifacts are missing.
