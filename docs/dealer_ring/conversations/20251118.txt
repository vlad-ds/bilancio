Vlad
00:00
entities, right? Three dealers, three VBT.
Vlad
00:04
Right, and we need that. Are you recording on your thing?
Colleague
00:08
I just remembered, I just started.
Vlad
00:11
Okay, so we need three dealers and three
Vlad
00:16
VBTs.
Colleague
00:17
Yeah.
Vlad
00:19
They are defined by the term, so there is a short-term, mid-term, and long-term. We then define the debt in terms of when it's maturing: short-term if it's maturing next period or in one or two periods. I'm not sure whether that's fully fixed or being specified; maybe the double of that, and then long-term is everything beyond.
Vlad
00:52
We can generally have our
Vlad
01:00
number of days and number of maturities that show up be more than what we have. It will be a bit hard to make this work with only five
Vlad
01:13
days, so maybe we can try to do it with 10 days or 15 days.
Colleague
01:17
Yeah.
Vlad
01:18
We need that because what becomes important in this story is this moment
Vlad
01:24
when certain debt moves from being in the mid-term into the short-term market, from the long-term into the mid-term market. The reality of the debt term structure is such that we always have this very long stuff, like 10 year, 20 year, 30 year, and then we have this very short stuff, like day, week, month. We need to replicate that reality a little bit for this whole distinction between money market and debt market to really make sense.
Vlad
02:00
For the dealer to really be able to make a difference, let me put it this way: the next piece of the story is
Vlad
02:09
that the balance sheets are simple. The balance sheets of both VBTs and dealers are such that they hold cash.
Vlad
02:18
The relevant type of security. Next piece of information is that unlike other traders,
Vlad
02:28
which in terms of what they hold as assets can only hold a debt claim at the beginning, can only hold the debt claim over one other entity in a ring story,
Colleague
02:39
Mm-hmm.
Vlad
02:39
the dealers will hold debt of more than one place.
Colleague
02:46
Yeah, of course.
Vlad
02:47
And the other important piece is that our dealers and value-based traders need to be much larger than our traders.
Vlad
02:59
And the initial setup that I came up with is this.
Vlad
03:05
Of a hundred percent debt in a given maturity, 25% is held by the dealer at the starting points and 50% by the value-based trader.
Vlad
03:17
So value-based trader is this huge balance sheet. There is this big balance sheet and there are a lot of these small trader balance sheets.
Colleague
03:27
Yes.
Vlad
03:29
The next piece is that
Vlad
03:37
we then have the dealer at the beginning set at the good dealer and value-based trader, in terms of the balance sheet, set to be in a balanced position, which means that they have equal value of securities valued at the
Vlad
03:56
value-based trader's mid value, which we'll talk about in a second, and money. So they have a hundred million dollars of money and a hundred million dollars of security on the relevant maturity, given
Vlad
04:10
the value estimate of the securities, that is the mid of the outside of the value-based trader.
Vlad
04:21
So they're in the middle, and this means that they can do most. They have more space to move in either one of the directions in terms of their operations.
Vlad
04:34
Okay, so there is the setup. There is our setup.
Colleague
04:38
Okay, so
Colleague
04:41
my question—
Colleague
04:44
One thing that comes to mind, or do you want to say more?
Vlad
04:47
I'm going to say both. And the next piece is the pricing.
Vlad
04:52
So the value-based trader is externally set at the beginning,
Colleague
04:57
Yeah,
Vlad
04:57
right?
Colleague
04:57
yeah, the anchorage.
Vlad
04:58
He simply sets his pricing.
Vlad
05:01
Based on his pricing, based on our equations, we can derive the dealer pricing for the first trade.
Vlad
05:12
And there is that whole
Vlad
05:19
set of equations that we have
Vlad
05:25
dictate the balance sheet of the dealer and the quotes from the value-based trader and set up what the dealer has.
Vlad
05:34
Quotes, and then we can start. We can start your simulation.
Vlad
05:41
Right, and what then is going to be happening immediately in the first period
Vlad
05:46
and in general in every period after, to different extents,
Vlad
05:54
is that the traders, the holders of debt and debt repairs, are going to be basically two types of situations.
Vlad
06:03
One is going to be the situation where they are in need of money because they are supposed to pay very soon.
Vlad
06:16
and they don't have enough cash on hand.
Vlad
06:19
and there is a situation in which they are going to have
Vlad
06:28
sufficient cash, more than they need, and maybe they need more than they need in the short term either because they simply have more cash than they need to pay or because they don't need to pay their debt in the short term, but will have to pay it down the line.
Vlad
06:48
And the point of
Vlad
06:53
that is that then those who have a shortfall, who have less cash than needed, are going to try to sell their securities that they hold, their debt claims over others,
Vlad
07:09
to the right kind of dealer.
Vlad
07:13
And those that are having a surplus in terms of cash are going to try to invest it in securities.
Vlad
07:26
in that place, and they're going to buy that place from the dealer.
Colleague
07:31
Yes.
Vlad
07:33
ends
Vlad
07:36
and so that's the second piece, and then there we have the whole kind of quantitative setup for how they make this decision
Vlad
07:46
right, which is fully specified.
Vlad
07:54
Yeah. And we can run, and then as we run, there are a couple of things that are happening. First, they are coming to the dealer, there is a random pick. They come to the dealer one by one.
Colleague
08:07
Yeah.
Vlad
08:09
So we pick one of the traders, he has the need to do one of the things mentioned, we get the right kind of dealer, the dealer then using the quote executes the trade and then sets a new quote.
Vlad
08:26
And we repeat until
Vlad
08:30
either all of them are executed
Vlad
08:35
or they are not executed.
Vlad
08:41
But the dealer has reached the limit.
Vlad
08:45
In which case, then the dealer needs to help you with the value-based trader.
Vlad
08:51
He needs to obtain the money or the security from the relevant kind of value-based trader at his spread.
Vlad
08:58
and then he's going to perform the thing for the trader.
Vlad
09:06
The next step is
Vlad
09:09
default. So what can happen is we can have default
Vlad
09:15
in which case
Vlad
09:18
the defaulting party is going to be always a party that ultimately only has cash, because the defaulting party is the party that had the shortfall.
Vlad
09:31
It needed cash and it sold off whatever debt claim it held, but
Vlad
09:37
what ended up happening is that the amount of cash that he ended up with was not enough, so he had to default. In the case where he defaults, the cash is distributed proportionally to all that hold that claim over it. Very simple rule.
Vlad
09:57
We just distribute the cash.
Vlad
09:59
which happens in the case of defaults.
Vlad
10:08
Two other things: one is that the dealer's balance changes in the sense that the asset that he possibly had is now disappearing and he has received some cash. So his balance is changing or his inventory position is changing, and also the size of his inventory is changing altogether because he has received less than he was supposed to.
Vlad
10:31
So he will reset his quotes on that basis, right? But what is also happening is that the value-based trader has also been holding the ES.
Vlad
10:44
Now that the default has occurred, he is going to price the thing. So we have the quantity to set up for the value-based trader, which changes his mid-end quote from wherever it was based on the amount of defaults that has happened.
Colleague
11:00
Mm-hmm.
Vlad
11:02
Okay.
Colleague
11:07
Yes.
Vlad
11:07
So the default that's going to then happen and then the final piece, based on what he quotes and based on the new position of the dealer in terms of his balance sheet, he's going to now reset his quote.
Vlad
11:19
And the final piece of the story is the case where it has changed its bucket in the sense that at a certain time point some debt becomes short term and was midterm, in which case we have the rules that set the way in which the dealer, let's say the short-term dealer—
Vlad
11:50
The thing is quite simple, right? The case is that the midterm debt is becoming short-term debt. Current midterm becomes short-term at the same time when the short-term debt matures.
Colleague
12:08
Hmm.
Vlad
12:08
So our short-term dealer is going to be receiving cash flow on the maturing short-term debts.
Vlad
12:17
Then he's going to use that cash flow to buy up what is now becoming the short-term debt from the midterm dealer.
Vlad
12:26
The midterm dealer is going to be receiving cash and then he's going to buy up the long-term debt that is becoming the midterm debt.
Colleague
12:36
Okay.
Vlad
12:38
Right. And the same thing with the value-based treatment.
Vlad
12:42
This is to some extent going to change the shape of their balance sheet and then they're going to recall the dealers, but ultimately, all the same rules are going to be applied.
Vlad
13:01
That's all that's happening. The debt is being repaid and we are ultimately still concerned with the same kind of dependent variables, output variables that we are interested in, which is what is happening to repayment, first and foremost. How good is our system now at clearing that given the parameters?
Colleague
13:26
So it's the same observed variable that—
Vlad
13:28
Exactly.
Colleague
13:28
You care about.
Vlad
13:29
We are still analyzing the same thing. We are just trying to see whether, as Jan says in the video,
Vlad
13:38
ultimately the presence of this kind of centralized market maker for this is going to help this become better. The idea would be the comparable system—the simple test should be that in most cases the comparable system that has the dealer to the one which doesn't ends up repainting work.
Colleague
14:05
So you will redo the same simulation just with the classic ring or something.
Colleague
14:10
Then look at the difference.
Vlad
14:11
Yeah, we are not going to work on all the other things we want to implement, we will implement later. For the moment, we want to bring these two functionalities in.
Vlad
14:22
If that works, when we get that to work, we can then go back to adding other stuff if you want.
Colleague
14:32
Okay, so a more specific question was that this is how time currently works.
Colleague
14:41
In our simulation, you go by days.
Colleague
14:45
Each day I'm just going to read it for the recording. Phase A starts the day and simply logs the time marker. I think Phase A we kept as a placeholder for
Colleague
14:55
Brokers
Colleague
14:56
and stuff. Phase B executes any user scheduled action first and then automatically settles all payables or delivery obligations
Colleague
15:06
fall due on that day.
Colleague
15:08
And Phase C performs the intraday clearing pass so banks square their nets before the clock turns over.
Vlad
15:16
We don't have that yet.
Colleague
15:18
What do you mean?
Vlad
15:20
That doesn't exist currently. There are no banks.
Colleague
15:23
It does exist in the Bilantro.
Colleague
15:26
Yes, it—
Vlad
15:26
Yeah,
Colleague
15:26
was implemented.
Vlad
15:27
Yeah, but you're not using it, right?
Colleague
15:28
Not using it. But this is our time structure, okay, so we need to figure out how to
Colleague
15:39
integrate.
Colleague
15:41
So...
Vlad
15:42
Yes.
Colleague
15:44
I mean, the dealer stuff happens before the...
Colleague
15:49
The...
Colleague
15:50
the debt clearing.
Vlad
15:51
I have that, I have that, please.
Vlad
16:12
So that is section 11, stimulation event loop.
Vlad
16:21
We are going to take this time step and then we are going to obviously add things there.
Vlad
16:31
First we update the maturities in buckets.
Colleague
16:34
Yeah.
Vlad
16:37
Then the dealer does his quotations.
Vlad
16:45
Then the agents compute their liquidity shortfall. This question of do I need to pay and do I have enough cash.
Colleague
16:56
Yeah.
Vlad
17:07
Then we are going to determine whether the shortfall-facing agents are going to be eligible to sell because
Vlad
17:18
they are in a shortfall-facing situation and they are owning some claim on someone else at the current moment.
Vlad
17:29
They are eligible to buy in the case where they have surplus cash. They have cash and they don't have any shortfall.
Vlad
17:48
Then we're going to set up that and then we're going to do this dealer interaction. One of the agents will be drawn, then he will approach the right dealer with the right proposition.
Vlad
18:02
The proposition will be executed at the quotes the dealer gives, then the dealer will record.
Vlad
18:18
Until we get to a place where all of the agents that have either one of the two positions—that they want to buy or that they want to sell—are out.
Colleague
18:31
Right.
Vlad
18:33
Everybody will be out. Then we are going to do the settlement of the maturing debt.
Vlad
18:42
That's exactly the same as it was.
Colleague
18:46
Mm-hmm.
Vlad
18:48
We are just going to do that. In the case that there is a bank default, now we have the rule for the default which we didn't have.
Vlad
18:58
We are not going to stop the simulation at default. We're going to count the default but we're also going to distribute the cash
Vlad
19:11
that exists on the balance sheet of the defaulting party to the holders. We have a rule for how that's going to happen.
Vlad
19:21
If that has happened, the value-based trader, if there are any defaults, will re-quote according to the rule.
Colleague
19:32
Hmm.
Vlad
19:32
As he quotes, then the dealer will re-quote too.
Vlad
19:37
And that's the end of the day. Then we go on to the next day.
Colleague
19:42
Right.
Colleague
19:47
Yeah, I just need on the technical side to figure out whether
Colleague
19:51
to fit it in the current
Colleague
19:54
simulation engine or to make a new simulation engine, but that's just a technical question.
Colleague
20:00
I think.
Vlad
20:00
I would not want us to lose what we already have, right? So it would be good to copy everything in.
Vlad
20:10
Keep the version that you have
Vlad
20:13
on the one side and then do a new version based on the version we have plus changing things.
Colleague
20:20
Yeah, no, we won't lose anything.
Colleague
20:23
Yeah, it's just a technical thing.
Vlad
20:29
Okay, cool.
Colleague
20:34
I think the best will be to just start and then as I work through it I can send more questions.
Vlad
20:49
Yeah, I mean, I think when you get the setup for the dealer and the time thing, then you can try out this toy example.
Vlad
21:03
Right, we are not going to have the real thing.
Colleague
21:03
Yeah.
Colleague
21:06
Yep.
Vlad
21:08
But I'm going to prompt the dealer to do something based on some of the events that are a matter.
Colleague
21:17
So these are just dealer-centered.
Vlad
21:20
Yeah, these are all dealer-centric.
Colleague
21:27
And then...
Vlad
21:28
I hope they're good. I didn't check the examples as much, but I got GPT to check it several times in several ways. He said they would be acceptable.
Colleague
21:41
And then this is this last document.
Colleague
21:47
Is it more information?
Vlad
21:50
Additional instructions for specifications.
Vlad
21:57
I asked him if he has any additional things that he thinks we should be specifying.
Colleague
22:03
Okay.
Vlad
22:06
He said this.
Colleague
22:08
Did you do it with 5 Pro?
Colleague
22:11
Nice, okay.
Vlad
22:13
I did almost everything here with a five draw, step by step, piece by piece.
Colleague
22:18
Right.
Colleague
22:23
Okay, so yeah, I think I'm good for now.
Vlad
22:27
Okay, if anything is not fully clear, I checked as much as I could, you let me know, and we can, I think it will always be something minor so we can just get some kind of...
Vlad
22:46
We can resolve it in whatever way and then we can change the way we resolve it if we decide.
Vlad
22:52
You know, some equation is missing or something is not exactly clear.
Vlad
23:01
But it should be, I worked through it quite in detail.
Colleague
23:08
What else did I want to say?
Vlad
23:13
Will you come to Frankfurt?
Vlad
23:16
When?
Colleague
23:32
I think I might not be able.
Vlad
23:36
You know, is it in December?
Vlad
23:43
Yes.
Colleague
23:43
Ah.
Colleague
23:45
I filled my December with trips.
Vlad
23:49
Good. Where are you going?
Colleague
23:50
I'm gonna go to Istanbul.
Vlad
23:54
Okay, that's cool.
Colleague
23:55
So I get a piece of Asia.
Vlad
23:58
Ukrainian.
Colleague
23:59
Now I mean like travel, I'm in travel mode. I have to go outside of Europe, like I told you, right?
Vlad
24:08
You should.
Colleague
24:09
And this is an easy choice because it's close and it's cheap.
Vlad
24:14
I thought you had Istanbul there in Berlin, but you know.
Colleague
24:17
I do.
Vlad
24:19
But you want the real thing.
Colleague
24:21
Yeah, I want the second row vibe.
Colleague
24:28
And I'm going, I'm going to go to my parents for a week.
Vlad
24:35
Right, for the Christmas.
Vlad
24:38
Okay.
Colleague
24:41
When is the Frankfurt...
Vlad
24:44
Mid-December.
Vlad
24:56
18th, on the 18th.
Colleague
24:58
Hmm.
Colleague
25:00
Because I'm back from Italy on the 19th.
Colleague
25:05
Maybe, but it starts on the 18th.
Vlad
25:09
It's just the 18th.
Vlad
25:11
Just before the 18th I will be there, but the 18th is the presentation, but you can be online, it's fine, it doesn't matter.
Colleague
25:16
Because, you know, maybe instead of taking the plane to Berlin from Italy, I take the plane to Frankfurt.
Vlad
25:26
You can share the room with me.
Colleague
25:30
Let me look at the flights. Yeah, it's good that we mentioned this because...
Vlad
25:38
I mean, if you come a day or two early, I'll be there, but hopefully...
Colleague
25:41
Okay, no day too early, no, because that will take my time in Italy, but maybe Wednesday or Thursday.
Vlad
25:48
That sounds great. If you can, I'd be very happy to have you and we can go together to Darmstadt and see what they're doing.
Colleague
26:00
The other thing is this, we got this email from Toporowski.
Colleague
26:06
First draft.
Colleague
26:08
Did you answer that?
Vlad
26:10
No.
Colleague
26:11
It was 11 days ago.
Vlad
26:15
It's okay, don't worry, he's an old man, he has no impatience, you know.
Colleague
26:20
I don't care, I just wanted to remind you.
Vlad
26:23
I get your feet, right? Like the...
Vlad
26:27
What we are doing is all within the program of studying this problem that he said. So we are not wasting our time doing what we are doing and what I want to do is finish up on our stuff. What he helps with is pitch this and frame this right because you can train the simulation that we are doing, the analysis that we are doing in many ways, ultimately.
Vlad
26:58
But the question is what conversation you want to focus on. And I think the conversation that you want to focus on that he suggests is exactly that one, it's the conversation around what in macroeconomics is the debt to GDP analysis or debt to cash flow analysis.
Vlad
27:20
With the idea that somehow you need an amount of cash flow to be occurring within the economy in order to deal with that.
Colleague
27:30
Yeah.
Vlad
27:32
Otherwise, you're in trouble and with fear trying to say not necessarily.
Colleague
27:40
Right. What do you mean not necessarily? I thought we wanted to say that you need liquidity to...
Vlad
27:47
No, we need liquidity, but liquidity is not about generating a bulk of cash flow.
Vlad
28:00
It's about alignment of debts, it's about the right liquidity being accessible at the right place at the right time, all the sizes, it's about this much more than we need to make real stuff and earn money otherwise.
Colleague
28:15
Ah, cash flow in sense of actual production, yeah.
Vlad
28:19
Exactly.
Vlad
28:22
Okay.
Vlad
28:26
So that's the very fundamental conversation in economics and we have...
Vlad
28:34
They have a rigorous method for studying this problem, more rigorous than anyone up until now.
Vlad
28:48
And so he gives us that kind of motivation background.
Vlad
28:55
So we will, I will,
Vlad
28:59
That's the least of our problems, right? It's good that we have him, it's good that he gave us his speech for it, and it's good to have him on board because he has a lot of knowledge and experience.
Vlad
29:17
I would follow his gut instinct in these things rather than my own.
Vlad
29:23
So that's it, right? Now it's just for us to continue planning through it and developing it.
Vlad
29:38
We can see about it. Let's plumb through it as far as we can and as much as we can up until the beginning of December.
Vlad
29:45
Then I'll put together the presentation and we can think of the publication, because we could already try publishing the way we have it.
Vlad
29:54
But I think with the neurosurgeon, we could have a bit more if we want to have a more serious type of publication with the team meeting.
Colleague
30:07
Alright, let's do it.
