Hello
Unknown
01:38
How are you?
Alex
01:40
I'm dead, it's 11:15, I'm still in the office.
Unknown
01:43
Ah, shit.
Unknown
01:45
That's crazy.
Alex
01:47
I just had a meeting, so this is the last one.
Alex
01:51
Okay, so I did some work.
Alex
01:59
He has a version and then I have another version very soon. Let me share this version with you first.
Alex
02:07
You can torture it a bit.
Alex
02:19
Sedition warts.
Sam
02:28
Okay.
Alex
02:34
So let me take you through this.
Alex
02:42
So basically, first of all, I define what we care about.
Alex
02:50
And what we care about is what I call here a functional dealer.
Alex
02:56
Or whatever function of dealer behavior.
Alex
03:00
And the idea is that the dealer is willing to both sell and buy.
Alex
03:10
And that over the relevant horizon, he is trying to make money and his principle not like getting totally destroyed by being involved in these trades. He doesn't need to end up making money but he needs to try to make money and not at least fail miserably at it.
Sam
03:32
Yeah.
Alex
03:34
That's the point we need from the dealer, besides what we already know about for the trader.
Alex
03:42
The idea is that we want the trader to be trying to make money.
Alex
04:16
So we want the trader to try to make money in principle, not at least because he needs to repay, but also even beyond that, that he wants to earn money.
Alex
04:34
But also, of course, to be earning money, having in mind that he needs to repay when he needs to repay, so he doesn't want to take some excessive risk in terms of investment.
Sam
04:46
Hmm.
Alex
04:53
This is already clear that you get liquidity when you sell to the dealer. Repayment priority on stream, this is what they just explained.
Alex
05:09
Yeah, within the repayment priority constraints that they tried to make.
Alex
05:15
Okay.
Alex
05:27
And then what we do here, just give me one second.
Alex
06:20
And then basically we come up with a set of, okay, you can even skip everything until seven, go to section seven on page 12. I don't even know whether we need, I think maybe this will, I don't need to clean it up.
Alex
06:37
And then you can see here what we have for analysis on the basis of these ideas of what happened in our simulation.
Alex
06:49
Implemented dealer is functionally capable of reducing defaults across the 125.3 and the mean default rate falls by about 90% and there are no cases where dealer reverses defaults.
Alex
07:05
However, you roughly at a quantum parameter space either if also already zero or the remaining before so not alleviated at all, indicating regions where retraining applies. Dealer fixed outside capital cannot resolve structural liquidity problems.
Alex
07:21
Behaviorally, the current design does not formulate the narrative of traders seeking yield while always prioritizing repayment. In aggregate, enabling buying slightly reduces relief of debt. This is what you told me.
Alex
07:39
And key elements of the specification, dealer profits and losses dynamics, trader returns, explicit repayment priority metrics are not measured, right?
Sam
07:48
This is what we have until now.
Sam
07:51
This is what we did until now.
Sam
07:54
This is the results.
Alex
07:54
This was the analysis, what we did, right? And the main thing about the analysis is that we first need to introduce a couple of indicators that are simply going to measure what is already going on.
Alex
08:11
So that we get a better sense of what is going on in terms of the things that matter to us. Okay.
Alex
08:21
So given the already existing simulation, we want to understand.
Sam
08:30
You are saying we're going to add more metrics to the existing simulation?
Alex
08:32
Yes, just metrics of analysis, not parameters.
Sam
08:37
Like the behavior will be the same, but we will be measuring more stuff.
Alex
08:40
Yeah, we want to measure these few things, right?
Alex
08:58
So consider the single, in 8.1, simulation run index star between time periods this.
Alex
09:08
We have the aggregate metrics that already exist.
Alex
09:19
And we have the counts of sizes of defaults in distribution of recovery across the shares. And then we have the dealer.
Alex
09:33
And then we have the trader, right?
Alex
09:36
We require a trade log for each dealer trade at time T, record time T bucket.
Alex
09:47
Buy, sell, agent price, issue maturity.
Alex
09:53
And then this helps us construct the diagnostic.
Alex
09:57
Which is dealer profit loss, profitability, trader investment return, and liquidity use.
Alex
10:16
Specifically liquidity-driven sales and rescues.
Alex
10:20
Repayment priority, to what extent they observe the repayment priority.
Alex
10:31
And that's basically it.
Alex
10:35
So we get measures that we can then observe for these runs.
Sam
10:41
Yeah.
Sam
10:43
So that's the main point, just add these measures.
Alex
10:46
So that will be the first point, right? Once we do that, we get into this part.
Alex
10:55
Let me give you, I have a version 3.0, let me give you a new version of this document just because I was working on this last section.
Alex
11:04
It would be probably the most clear and useful to it.
Alex
11:18
So here we go.
Alex
11:24
Here is the same document, but it has additional bits at the end.
Alex
11:34
So what I did, like is I thought together with him about ways in which
Alex
11:41
So my sense is, and I think, is that we will see that the system doesn't perform well according to these new metrics.
Alex
11:52
Right. We'll see that the dealer is mostly losing money.
Alex
11:58
Trading like investing in securities often leads the entities to lose money as well over time.
Alex
12:10
It just doesn't do what we would like it to do in a kind of realistic sense.
Sam
12:17
Okay.
Alex
12:19
So the point would be to possibly then add one or more of these few things that could help us get it to do the things we want to do.
Alex
12:35
And I have three things, right? So one is that we introduce the coupon to the claim.
Alex
12:43
There is basically an additional amount of money, like a bonus, like a premium that you earn if you hold the security to the end.
Sam
12:53
Ah, okay.
Alex
12:55
Right?
Sam
12:55
If you hold, if you hold.
Sam
12:58
The security, like
Sam
13:02
I have a debt security.
Alex
13:11
Yeah, the face value of the security is $300 but at the repayment it pays $310. So the security is issued to obtain $100.
Sam
13:18
That's like the interest payment.
Alex
13:20
Yeah, interest is a very ambiguous term, but yeah, it's some kind of premium that you get for holding until maturity.
Sam
13:30
But if I sell the security, what happens to the coupon?
Alex
13:35
It goes with the security.
Sam
13:37
So it goes to the last one who holds it when it expires.
Alex
13:42
Exactly.
Alex
13:44
So this should be something that enables the investors in security to have reason to invest in it, to gain more money than they put into it at the beginning, right?
Alex
14:08
I need to still think more about this. I'm just giving you...
Sam
14:12
It needs to affect the sale price of the security because I'm not just selling you the security, I'm selling you a claim on the coupon.
Alex
14:23
Yes.
Sam
14:23
And the closer you are to the coupon, the more valuable it is because you're likely to get it.
Alex
14:27
Yes.
Alex
14:32
In principle, yes, but not always, because maybe if you're thinking that it's going to default, then the closer you are the worse, right? Because if you're thinking short-term debt is going to default, you're ready to pay more for your longer-term debt.
Sam
14:44
Yeah.
Sam
14:48
Yeah.
Alex
14:49
Anyway, so that's one thing. We'll see exactly whether it can do the job and how exactly.
Alex
14:59
The second is a bit more complicated. It's simple to explain, but probably a bit more complicated to implement. What it amounts to is instead of running one, it amounts to thinking about this sequence as a loop.
Alex
15:16
So when you repay that, you immediately get new debts at the next maturity.
Sam
15:30
I didn't understand.
Alex
15:32
So basically, let's say I'm a trader and I have a debt to repay at T10 for a 300. And it then comes and I repeat. Instead of my liabilities being cleared out, I issue a new piece of debt.
Alex
15:55
This would make it so that we could run the simulation for a longer period of time, right?
Alex
16:02
So we could have, let's say, a sequence. If the first set of debts matures as the maximum maturity of 10, we could have one 10-period set and then another 10-period set and then another 10-period set, maybe three or four periods. We don't need an infinite amount.
Alex
16:19
But the point of this is that there are two points that this would add to our story. One is that if the dealers start, for example, empty with no securities in the first loop, in the second loop, they will not be able.
Sam
16:42
Right, then you will be more balanced over time.
Alex
16:45
The other thing that it does is in our system, because it just has one loop, it starts with our dealers having no securities and a lot of money, then buying up a lot of securities. And then as time goes by, because not a lot of people are buying securities from them, they end up holding them to maturity. The securities slowly mature and disappear and the dealers get cash, right? So a dealer starts with only cash, gets an amount of securities for a time, and then those securities mature. At the end of the simulation, the dealer again has no security.
Alex
17:35
But we don't want that, right? We want our dealers not in this kind of position but rather in a position where they have an ongoing balance of securities and cash. They are not getting completely dried out of securities because everything matures and nothing new is issued.
Sam
17:59
Yeah.
Alex
18:01
So that's the second mechanism that could help us.
Alex
18:06
And then the third one is very simple, right? The third one is the way we can think of the treatment and control thing that we are doing.
Sam
18:15
Hmm.
Alex
18:15
The problem that we encountered is that we were comparing a system where we had a set of debts distributed among these agents without a dealer. And then a set of these debts, this end money distributed between these agents and then a dealer full of money.
Sam
18:39
Right.
Alex
18:41
And of course, if you have an entity that is full of money in a story where people are kind of tight on money and need to pay the debt, and that guy is willing to give them money for whatever they have, it's going to be less defaults for sure, right? It's the system that has more money and the entity that has money is willing to give it to the entities that need it. So of course there will be less performance.
Sam
19:04
Yeah,
Alex
19:06
So the comparison is a big pears and apples, right?
Sam
19:09
Yeah,
Alex
19:09
But the comparison which has passive holders, right? So agents that have money in debt by their agents, but they're just like, it's basically a system that says we have the types of agents that we defined, but we single out six agents where we define how big they have to be in terms of their money and their asset claims that they hold. They have no debt to repay, right? But they are no dealers.
Sam
19:52
They
Alex
19:52
Right.
Sam
19:52
just have money and no debt.
Alex
19:55
Yeah, so basically we are creating a mid scenario between the scenario of dealers that have security claims and cash claims, and the scenario where there is no dealer support.
Sam
20:14
Yeah, but what do these people do? They just have money. What do they do with it?
Alex
20:17
They have money and they have claims, right?
Sam
20:24
So they have to be paid so they will make even more money.
Sam
20:32
So they're just owed money.
Alex
20:38
Yes, so there, yes, and the reason why this is going to be helpful is because they are going to take losses if there are defaults, but they are not going to default themselves, right? So they're holding these claims.
Sam
21:09
Ah, so the...
Alex
21:12
But they are not trading this crypto, right, but they can soak up defaults that could occur in the system without defaulting themselves and propagating before by their own dealers. So they're a much better control group for the dealer world.
Sam
21:36
Okay,
Alex
21:36
right
Sam
21:36
I understand. Because they affect the metric,
Alex
21:38
because
Sam
21:39
metric of percentage of default.
Alex
21:40
makes a difference
Sam
21:41
They affect the metric of default percentage.
Sam
21:46
Exactly. The dimension will
Alex
21:46
to cut down the default. Exactly. They're going to cut down the default.
Alex
21:51
But they are not going to cut it down the way that but hopefully the dealers are not going to cut it down more.
Sam
21:59
Yeah.
Alex
22:01
So that should be a relatively simple thing, right? All we need is to get the setup to identify these actors and that they have a position that is pretty fine in terms of its ratio to other positions, right?
Alex
22:23
And that would give us a better comparison.
Alex
22:27
That would be the one thing. We get this kind of comparison.
Alex
22:33
And then we see about these first two things, right? Whether we have this looping mechanic and whether we have this coupon mechanic, this premium mechanic.
Alex
22:47
Because those two should help get the dealer to operate a bit more realistically and also get the possibility of earning by holding on to the assets to be a reality.
Sam
23:10
Okay.
Alex
23:12
And so now I also put down this additional, which are supposed to help us implement it in the tent.
Alex
23:30
But with vegan start is like simply looking at the implementation for these metrics and getting the metrics.
Sam
23:41
Okay.
Alex
23:44
That should be, I guess, maybe not so difficult because the simulation stays the same.
Alex
23:53
And then we can take a look at the metrics.
Sam
23:57
All right. So I'll do that ASAP.
Alex
24:04
If you get it to me before you go, I will then work on it when you fly.
Sam
24:11
Okay.
Sam
24:12
Yeah, I can do that.
Alex
24:15
And then you can see whether one of these additional tools exactly is going to be helpful.
Alex
24:22
I know that I'm not. There is more there to think about.
Alex
24:38
That's it for me.
Sam
24:39
Nice. Are you going for dinner?
Alex
24:42
11 p.m. What dinner are we talking about? I may have dinner before any of—
Sam
24:48
I don't know, maybe a Spanish dinner.
Alex
24:52
Maybe sharing dinner.
Alex
24:57
Oh, phew, exactly.
Alex
24:59
No, I'm going home and I'm going to immediately bite the pillow because I have to be back here tomorrow by nine.
Sam
25:09
All right.
Alex
25:12
It's okay.
Alex
25:15
But it's fine. I don't mind. And this is exciting. If we can nail it, I feel we are close. We just need to tighten it a little bit.
Sam
25:26
Yeah, we got lucky that they dropped this Opus 4.5.
Alex
25:32
You think it's much better?
Sam
25:33
Yeah, it's definitely an improvement.
Alex
25:42
Yeah.
Alex
25:44
I'm sad I can't use it.
Sam
25:46
But I mean you could, you're just paying for the pro. It's just a money thing, right?
Alex
25:55
But I feel like if I need to pour it over all my stuff, it's just so hard.
Sam
26:01
Now, I think it's a good combination. Like you have pro now and you use pro as the subject matter expert. And I have Claude and I code with him. That's a good combo.
Alex
26:15
But we need to see what about these students because they will need class probably.
Sam
26:21
I mean the students can use Codex. Yeah, because...
Alex
26:25
It is.
Sam
26:26
They can pay the 20 euro a month and they should get enough Codex and Codex is also good.
Alex
26:33
They have pro, they said they have pro, so they probably have put it—
Sam
26:37
Problems.
Alex
26:39
Yeah.
Sam
26:40
All right then.
Alex
26:42
We're rich students. These are rich NYU students, you know.
