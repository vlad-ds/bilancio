Alex (Sasa) Feedback on C & D Requirements
==========================================
Date: 2025-12-04

Context: Claude provided interpretation of requirements C & D for the three-way comparison
(passive holders vs dealers). Alex responded to the clarifying questions.

Re A.1 "How off-balance the dealer and VBT"
(12:42)

This is correct - just how far it is from midpoint in inventory

---

Re Question 4 (Comparison structure):
(Edited 12:48)

The main comparison will be between passive large holders versus traders [dealers].
The less important is between passive large holders and no passive large holders.
There is no point comparing dealers and no passive holders as the effect of structure
of holdings of claims (even if we control for initial debt to money ratio) will differ.

Re Question 3 (Balance calculation / how many securities):
(12:48)

This relates to my comment about 4. Essentially we need a rule that preserves the
structure of holdings of securities and money from no large entities case in the
passive large entities case. I am open to Claude's suggestion.

An option could be: each trader has an additional percent of debt liabilities given
its debt in no big entities case, the claim on that debt is held by relevant big entity.
Given the amount of debt claims they hold these entities then also get to have as much
money to have balanced inventory. Also the traders are given additional cash such that
their cash to debt ratio from the case without big entities is preserved.

Re Question 2 (What securities do mimics/dealers start with):
(13:07)

The above responds to 2 as well

---

Re Question 1 (Face value of 20):
(13:23)

This one is the trickiest. Give me more time to think

(18:51)

The way we wanted to do it is that we have the ticket size as the size of a single
debt claim (in terms of cashflow at maturity) which was supposed to be 20. Then,
the outside mid could be somehow related to that value. Meaning that it could be
either the full value or some percentage of the full value, such as 90% or 80%, etc.

---

Summary of Answers:
- A.1 (off-balance): Confirmed - distance from midpoint in inventory
- Q1 (face value): Ticket size = 20 (cashflow at maturity), outside mid is a percentage of this (100%, 90%, 80%, etc.)
- Q2 (what securities): Answered by Q3 response - big entities hold claims on additional debt issued by traders
- Q3 (how many securities): Each trader issues additional debt (as % of their existing debt), big entities hold these claims. Big entities get matching cash for balanced inventory. Traders also get extra cash to preserve their original cash-to-debt ratio.
- Q4 (comparison structure): Main comparison is passive holders vs dealers (with trading). Secondary is passive holders vs no big entities. No direct comparison of dealers vs no big entities.
