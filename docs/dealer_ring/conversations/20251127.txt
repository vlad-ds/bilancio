Jamie
01:01
How is your task going?
Jamie
01:07
It's a lot.
Jamie
01:10
My bad.
Jamie
01:12
But it's fun.
Riley
01:14
Yeah, so it's basically like build an entire AI application to ingest legal contracts and analyze them.
Riley
01:27
Chat about them and alert when they're about to expire and upload new ones. It's just a ton of stuff.
Jamie
01:36
Okay, but it sounds like day one.
Riley
01:41
I'm the only one in the pipeline.
Jamie
01:44
So it's like if you do it well, it should be possible, right?
Riley
01:49
Yeah, it should be, right? Obviously, I'm doing it very well.
Jamie
01:55
When are you going to give them the things?
Riley
01:59
Yeah, they gave me two weeks.
Riley
02:01
The problem is that the second week I am in Istanbul for the trip.
Riley
02:09
So I'm gonna try to do as much as I can before I leave for the trip.
Riley
02:14
But it's good.
Jamie
02:18
Right, it's also the two weeks when I need you most.
Riley
02:21
Exactly, but I knew it would all come at once, so it's alright.
Jamie
02:27
Okay, let's do our thing.
Riley
02:31
Yes, how are you?
Jamie
02:33
Good. I'm trying to finish up the second piece for them, simulation, and then I need to put it together for the presentation on the night and I'm just hoping we can get it to work by then.
Riley
02:50
Okay.
Riley
02:56
So I'm recording.
Jamie
02:58
Yeah.
Riley
03:07
The examples are good.
Riley
03:10
All that we—
Jamie
03:11
I think the model should be fine. So it's just about implementing it, right? And if the dealer works and the agent decision making on when to buy the security versus when not to and when to sell works, then we are in a good place.
Jamie
03:36
And we can just test it. All we want to know is exactly the same thing we used to know, right? So just if we have the dealer and this is a possibility, whether the amount of default compared to the previous case is less or more, right? I think this is for the moment the main consideration that we want.
Riley
04:01
So first of all, we said that we want a hundred.
Riley
04:06
Like agents.
Jamie
04:12
Yes, we want the system to work exactly the way we described the value-based trader dealer traders in terms of the size, in terms of shape. There's a little document, right? Nothing different.
Riley
04:26
So the control is that you have 100 agents without dealer or VBT, without anything.
Jamie
04:37
Yes.
Riley
04:38
That's the control and then you observe fire.
Riley
04:43
But you still explore that grid.
Jamie
04:52
We have the dealer and the trade, like we do each with and without, right? I think we still do all the variables, right?
Riley
05:01
And that is the same exact thing, but with the dealer.
Riley
05:08
With the dealer at the same grid, the same people, but with the dealer.
Riley
05:13
And you look at the delta in the file.
Riley
05:21
Okay, sounds quite simple.
Riley
05:26
But with the dealer, like what we had before.
Jamie
05:32
Mm-hmm.
Riley
05:35
There's a natural termination because when the maturity ends, the debts end.
Jamie
05:48
Yeah, and we still keep that the same way. Yeah, because the debts are still going to all be having a fixed maturity, right? And they're either going to—you know, nothing changes in that regard.
Riley
05:51
There will be a natural termination here?
Jamie
06:04
That's basically the way it is.
Riley
06:07
And is there any other verification we could add?
Riley
06:16
To the dealer simulation, I mean, no, we already have those checks you put in the PDF, the c1 to c6.
Riley
06:26
And I think those checks run continuously.
Jamie
06:30
Mm-hmm.
Riley
06:31
So that will ensure that it doesn't.
Jamie
06:35
Yeah, just keep doing the same thing, right? That's all we need.
Riley
06:41
It also wrote like 200 tests.
Jamie
06:45
Mm-hmm.
Riley
06:47
Okay, then I can do that like today, tomorrow.
Jamie
06:53
That'd be great if you can get that one done. I'll try to prepare by hopefully Monday or Tuesday the second piece fully the same way I did for this one and then we can try that as well.
Riley
07:09
Okay, cool.
Jamie
07:11
If you need me, you let me know and I'll be available.
Jamie
07:15
If anything doesn't work as planned, just let me know.
Riley
07:22
Okay, cool.
Riley
07:24
Yeah, I think that was it.
Jamie
07:26
Okay.
Jamie
07:29
You let me know I'm here. I'll be here for a few more hours. If you're working on it, you let me know and I'll help.
Riley
07:36
All right, I'll probably do it tonight.
Jamie
07:40
No problem.
Riley
07:41
Which will be your early—
Jamie
07:41
Be here at 2 o'clock.
Riley
07:42
Morning.
Jamie
07:46
Good, okay, talk.
Riley
07:47
All right.
Jamie
07:48
If you need anything, talk to you. If not, we talk maybe Monday.
Riley
07:54
Yeah, Monday I'm free. Monday is the last day I am here and the next day I go away. So Monday is good.
Jamie
08:03
Okay, hopefully I can make this easy enough so that we get something out of it.
Jamie
08:11
The government, illegally.
Riley
08:13
The PDFs for the dealer.
Riley
08:16
Altogether they were very good because it basically did everything on its own.
Jamie
08:22
Yes.
Jamie
08:26
I'm hoping to have the same kind of thing for the bank as well, and to be as clear. I have GPT to give me all the questions I need to answer to properly introduce it into the simulation.
Jamie
08:38
I've gone to part of it, I still need to go through more and I also have some more questions with regards to the model of the bank. It's a bit more complicated, the model of the bank. But I think the model is not right for the simulator. It's just that it's more complicated in terms of conceptually more complicated and more abstract.
Jamie
09:07
But I'll do my best to have it.
Jamie
09:11
So we can do it the same way.
Riley
09:12
And then the examples are great, right? Because it's—
Jamie
09:16
Yeah, we are working, that's how we figure out there is a problem because we saw that the example kind of had a problem in the way it was solved by GPT, so we can rework the example a bit and make sure that it polarizes.
Jamie
09:39
Yeah, hopefully it will be as good, the material I give you for the second.
Riley
09:44
Did you manage to use Cloud in Excel?
Jamie
09:47
I didn't use Chrome because I have to pay for it, right?
Riley
09:51
Ah, yes.
Jamie
09:56
Yeah, I have GPT. I'm okay. I didn't, you know, it's also fine that I write my Excel on my own by coloring things on my own a little bit and not just rely on AI.
Riley
10:05
Why?
Jamie
10:05
For everything.
Riley
10:05
It's 2025. We don't learn. It's out of style to learn things.
Jamie
10:10
All right.
Riley
10:12
We're in Wally mode.
Jamie
10:14
Yeah.
Riley
10:18
And the other thing is, last question, do you think you expect to combine dealer and banks?
Jamie
10:26
Yeah, that's the hope. I mean, we can do separate first and then the way I was developing the bank is being kind of separate, having the dealer already in, right? Because the problem with the banks is that the real kind of banking story needs more than a single bank, but we don't want that. It's going to be more complicated.
Jamie
10:53
So for the moment you want one bank and to make one bank work, bank is basically a dealer of its own kind that depends on the reserve level that it has, right? And in order for the reserve level to be meaningful, we need to have the dealer still be paid in cash, meaning in reserve, right? Versus the traders holding deposits.
Jamie
11:25
Tied by the fact that it has so much reserve and its depositors will cash in their deposits to buy securities from the dealer.
Riley
11:36
Okay.
Jamie
11:37
And so there is that question for the deposit for the traders whether they want to hold a deposit or they want to hold the security. If they want to hold the security, the bank is going to cash in their deposit in reserve to pay the dealer so that they can buy the security, right? And this is the—this is what makes the bank tight on reserve.
Jamie
12:03
Rather than just being a single bank that never has a problem with reserves.
Jamie
12:09
So that was the—because normally the bank has a problem with reserve because it needs to settle the payments to other banks.
Jamie
12:19
Between clients with the banks, you remember we worked on this.
Riley
12:22
Yeah.
Jamie
12:22
But that would mean we have to have more than one bank and the clients can move deposits between banks or any of the versions of that story.
Jamie
12:36
But that's, I feel, too complicated for the moment. One bank and then the dealer being the one paid in the reserve so that the bank doesn't simply have no need to ever give reserve to anyone. He's going to put the bank in a place where the reserve will be a constraint so it can work, the model can work.
Jamie
12:57
So yeah, it's gonna just be one bank, but the bank will be tied to the existence of the dealer.
Riley
13:05
Okay.
Riley
13:08
Okay, yeah, sounds—
Riley
13:10
Doable.
Jamie
13:11
Yeah, I mean there's just a few things there, right? There's like the way that the bank is modeled, which is basically like a number of formulas like for the dealer. And then there is basically the question of when does the bank lend and at what rate, which is kind of set by its formula, so that's easy, that's what we already have.
Jamie
13:37
And then we have the trader side of things, right? And the trader is going to have like an option to borrow and the option to hold a deposit versus holding a security. That's what changes. Currently, trader simply has needs to repay in the dealer model. It can also hold the security, buy it, hold it, sell it. And in this story, it can also hold a deposit rather than a security, which pays less interest but is more liquid and has less risk to it.
Jamie
14:16
In terms of how much value it's going to have at the end of the day when you need the money to pay, and it's also able to buy security, which is more risky. You don't know what's going to be its value and so on.
Jamie
14:33
And this is something we need to set a little bit in terms of how far can it go. They will be borrowing from the bank.
Riley
14:42
Hmm.
Jamie
14:43
And so, you know, probably we can give one borrowing chance to each trader or something like that, like simplified, not like having infinite amount of borrowing because then everybody can simply always borrow and you don't need to refine forever, right? But we don't want that, so we can probably constrain it to like one borrowing or something like that.
Jamie
15:09
And that's it, then it's fine.
Riley
15:12
Okay, cool.
Jamie
15:15
So shouldn't be too much more. There will be more like the model of the bank is more complex, but otherwise everything else should be pretty straightforward.
Riley
15:29
All right.
Riley
15:31
Then keep—
Jamie
15:32
Okay.
Riley
15:32
In touch.
Jamie
15:34
Yes. Tell me when. Ciao.
Riley
15:37
Ciao a tutti.
