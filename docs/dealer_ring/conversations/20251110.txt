to the requirements
Vlad
00:03
Not bad.
Vlad
00:06
I speak of my mom's time here. She's still here this week, she's traveling on Sunday morning.
Vlad
00:19
That's the schedule.
Vlad
00:26
Are you becoming German?
Colleague
00:27
Oh, I...
Colleague
00:31
I hope so. Yeah.
Vlad
00:34
When is it happening?
Colleague
00:35
days the test.
Colleague
00:40
But I looked at the materials and it's really easy.
Colleague
00:48
I only need to pass four modules, but each module I only need to get 60% of the score.
Vlad
00:56
Oh.
Vlad
00:57
Not even becoming a German is a serious thing anymore.
Colleague
01:01
Exactly.
Vlad
01:03
this world.
Vlad
01:07
Well, good. I'm sure you will cross and it will be fine.
Colleague
01:12
Yeah.
Vlad
01:15
Shall we get into it?
Colleague
01:17
Yeah, I just read what Jan sent, the essay.
Vlad
01:21
Right.
Vlad
01:24
I think that's fine. We can put together a version that can be okay in terms of texture, with GPT not worrying about putting any piece of text together anymore. Of course, the amount of hands-on work on the text we put mid-year ultimately is going to benefit, but that's fine. I think the question is more for us to understand what we're going to do, how can we expand it.
Colleague
02:00
Hmm.
Vlad
02:03
And I have an idea.
Colleague
02:04
Okay.
Vlad
02:05
Basically with Yamaha we have many different people. Do you want to turn on recording on your thing?
Colleague
02:11
I am.
Vlad
02:13
Okay, basically right, there were a number of things that we could improve and probably all of them are interesting in their own right, but I think the two main things—as long as we hold on to the same topology and a sense of equilibrium, basically like on one round of that settlement, right until the debt is settled.
Vlad
02:46
As long as those two are the way that they are, then there are two things to do, right? I think especially the equilibrium has to do with decision making and actions, and I feel that's an important bit, but maybe we can do a couple of things before we go into that, and then we can extend all these smaller things first and then get into the action choice in the chicken, because I think that's going to be a very different flavor of simulation once we get that thing.
Colleague
03:32
Yeah.
Vlad
03:34
So I thought the two things that would make sense would be basically to have a market for debt where these entities can sell this debt and buy it also possibly, but we can also just keep it about selling it. And also the banking system, borrowing money. So I would say these are the two things that would be good to integrate and they would be also good for my own at that point because what we would introduce for those two are a dealer and a bank, and those are the two things that I've been trying to model and they're important pieces.
Vlad
04:37
From my own standpoint of this money view type of research, my general project will be safe. So in both of these, I already have a pretty clearly set model for a simple bank and a simple dealer.
Vlad
05:13
So I think what we can do is introduce from the sampling of what we have, we should introduce an option to our borrower, the party involved, which is that they sell the assets that they hold if they hold an asset, in order to obtain liquidity that they can then use to repay their own debt.
Colleague
05:41
So they have the debt claim from another agent and sorry—
Vlad
05:49
Bless you.
Vlad
05:54
Are you okay?
Colleague
05:54
My ass hurts so much because I saw Jay and I fell from this bench in a bar.
Vlad
06:06
You fell from a bench.
Colleague
06:07
Yeah, it was an elevated bench and was not attached to anything and I was just swinging on it like an idiot. And I fell and it crashed the table, it crashed all the glasses and crashed the lamp, everyone's looking at me.
Vlad
06:24
He crushed your ass.
Colleague
06:26
I fell on my ass and since Friday evening, it still hurts me.
Vlad
06:34
Do you want to go check it?
Colleague
06:36
I think it's improving, give it some more days, but if I sneeze it hurts.
Vlad
06:43
Good God.
Vlad
06:44
I feel like you should go check the bones a little bit.
Colleague
06:48
Maybe.
Vlad
06:50
If you come to your seatbone, that's not good. You have to stay alone.
Colleague
06:56
Yeah, I hope it's not the bone and that it passes, but if it doesn't pass I'll check.
Colleague
07:04
Anyway, we're saying that in our simulation all they have is debt claims.
Vlad
07:13
So the point would be they sell the debt claim for cash.
Vlad
07:18
And we have a dealer who buys it.
Vlad
07:25
First of all, we'll have to make the model a little bigger in terms of the number of entities. So we can still keep all the parameters as they are, but we need to get the model to evolve more, because the dealer doesn't really make sense if we talk about the market proper, and we can't talk about a market proper if it's not a lot of claims.
Colleague
07:53
But do we want to start first with the banking because we already have some banking logic in our code? Or do you want to start with the dealer?
Vlad
08:01
Banking is going to be more complicated from this standpoint.
Colleague
08:06
Then we start with the dealer.
Vlad
08:07
For the moment, we don't have any banks. We just have a liability side of a central bank as a cash liability for the central bank.
Colleague
08:20
In this simulation, but in our broader library, there was a bit of work done on banking.
Vlad
08:27
It will be harder, and I have the work on the dealer complete and I will hopefully have the work on the banks complete in a week or so on that very simple map. The questions that we have here, the point is this: what we are looking at as a mechanism is you are a...
Vlad
08:54
We have more entities, they work the exact same way, they have the same story that we already have.
Vlad
09:02
If you're at the point where you need to repay, however, you don't have the money, you could sell an asset debt claim on another entity that you're holding to the...
Vlad
09:14
To the dealer and you could get money on that and you could use that money to repay your loan.
Colleague
09:20
Yeah.
Vlad
09:27
And that would be what we have. And then we have a deal where the price is this, right?
Colleague
09:35
So you can never get more money than what you're owed. You're going to get actually a bit less than what you're owed.
Colleague
09:43
Like, if you owe me 100 and I go and sell the debt to the dealer, the dealer will give me 80.
Vlad
09:49
Yeah. So, yeah.
Vlad
09:53
So this is the main point, right? The main introduction that we need to make here is the dealer pricing model.
Vlad
10:04
Right, we need a dealer pricing model and to have the dealer pricing model I will give you a paper that explains how this model works. We'll have to have a dealer and we'll keep a value-based trader. The difference between the two of them is they're both automatic, they're both going to be automatic, and they quote a price to buy and to sell the debt ultimately so that the dealer is the kind of someone who basically makes the market. But if the dealer runs out of the given type of money or of a given kind of security, then the value-based trader who offers worse prices steps in and takes over the trade.
Colleague
10:54
Huh.
Vlad
10:54
And offers you obviously worse price than the dealer, so you always want to trade with the dealer, but then if the dealer can't, then you go to the value-based trader. That's the logic. The main question with applying the dealer to this story is going to be about how does the dealer—and the point with this is that what we have is our security, our debt, our asset, our instrument is specified.
Vlad
11:40
The UMI in terms of the size, all the debt, and the counterparty they need to pay, and the time. So what we need to do, because for the dealer to make a market in it, to quote a price on it, there needs to be—we cannot have completely diverse instruments. These instruments are going to make a market if there is more than a single instrument, right?
Vlad
12:17
So we need to kind of classify this debt somehow.
Colleague
12:21
Oh.
Vlad
12:23
Right, so that the dealer could be buying or selling debt of a specific class.
Vlad
12:35
For example, so you as a holder hold a claim over someone, someone's debt. And when you go to sell it to the dealer, if you're in that situation where you need to sell it to the dealer, you are holding the debt of a particular class. So the dealer is going to pay you this much or that much for that. You can think of corporate A-grade debt versus B-grade versus C-grade or something like that.
Vlad
13:10
And obviously depending on which security you give to the dealer, the price on that security is going to change.
Vlad
13:21
Yeah. Right.
Vlad
13:23
The idea here is that we don't want to introduce the ability to buy the debt from the dealer because that would be more like an investment decision.
Vlad
13:44
Right, so let's imagine you have an entity and it has some cash and it doesn't need to repay anything anytime soon.
Colleague
13:49
Yeah, it's a way to make money,
Vlad
13:51
What the entity could do is it could invest and buy upon the dealer. But it complicates things and we don't necessarily need it. Why? Because what we can have is a mode of buying from the dealer is simply repayment. So if you think of the dealer holding some debt claim on someone,
Colleague
14:26
Mm-hmm.
Vlad
14:26
who buys the debt from the dealer in the sense that they could pay and take the claim or the borrower could simply repay.
Vlad
14:42
And when the borrower repays the dealer, it looks exactly as if somebody bought it from the dealer in the sense that the dealer is going to lose the asset and obtain money.
Colleague
14:53
No,
Vlad
14:53
Right.
Colleague
14:54
I didn't get this part because you have a debt and you repay the dealer.
Colleague
15:02
So you're just saying.
Vlad
15:04
A claim on a debt claim on someone, one of these IOUs, one that we were working with, right? The same way as one entity calls it on another.
Vlad
15:21
In a secondary market someone could come and buy that debt from the dealer. We have an entity and he has a lot of money that he doesn't need right now, he could come and buy.
Colleague
15:27
Yeah.
Vlad
15:27
Right?
Colleague
15:31
Mm-hmm.
Vlad
15:32
He buys it, the dealer gives the asset, and gains some money.
Vlad
15:40
Let's now imagine that borrower, that the dealer has the claim on,
Colleague
15:46
Yeah.
Vlad
15:46
whose debt is failing.
Colleague
15:48
Repays the debt.
Vlad
15:50
Again, the dealer will lose the asset and gain money.
Colleague
15:53
Yeah, but that's not buying because only one person can repay the debt. Only one entity can repay the debt.
Vlad
15:59
It's a repayment.
Colleague
16:01
So the debt is not for sale.
Vlad
16:04
Of course.
Colleague
16:12
Like what do you want to achieve here? Because you're saying, you know, buying debt as investment is maybe out of scope.
Vlad
16:20
Yeah, okay, you're right. Let's first think of what we want to achieve here. The point of introducing a dealer is to say if I have a dealer in a system, he is going to make the market more liquid, and making the market more liquid is going to make the default rate lower.
Colleague
16:50
Right, I get that.
Vlad
16:51
This is the point of the whole thing. The same thing with the Mac, right? If you have a bank that you can borrow from, the market is more liquid, right?
Vlad
17:04
So these are the two ideas. How will a bank and a dealer help this? What if there is a bank? What if there is a dealer in this system?
Vlad
17:20
And so for the dealer, if we would want to specify properly, we would specify both the possibility of selling to the dealer and the situation at which it happens and how it ends up being executed, and there's a possibility of buying from the dealer.
Colleague
17:41
But think about in our simulation, what do our agents want? Currently, they just want to pay their debts. So they're not interested in investing.
Colleague
17:52
They're interested in just getting liquidity.
Vlad
17:56
Yes.
Colleague
17:56
So if we have a situation where they can just
Vlad
17:59
sell their debt and get liquidity.
Vlad
18:03
Isn't that enough?
Colleague
18:06
Is it an issue if a debt,
Vlad
18:08
is.
Vlad
18:14
Possibly awkward because the dealer operates as someone who stands in the middle of a market between the borrowers and the debtors.
Colleague
18:21
Right, but in this situation the dealer would just accumulate.
Colleague
18:25
That, yeah.
Vlad
18:26
Yeah, the problem is that the dealer function will look a little weird in comparison to how it should look. And the other reason why this limitation is probably not a good idea is also because your goal is to repair debt.
Colleague
18:31
Yeah.
Vlad
18:51
But if you need to repay, let's say, an amount of debt and you are in a position where you have some money, but you don't have enough of it, or you just have some claim on someone else.
Vlad
19:02
And that claim is...
Vlad
19:08
Let's say you have some money, but you don't have enough of it.
Colleague
19:13
Yeah.
Vlad
19:15
You would be interested in investing the money that you have in a claim if that is going to lead to a situation where later on when you sell it, you get more money.
Vlad
19:27
If it's going to lead to a situation where later on when you sell it, you get more money.
Vlad
19:37
And you would want to sell it at the point where you need to repay, right?
Vlad
19:45
Yeah, I get it. Let's say you have 90 dollars and your repayment is a hundred in 10 days. If you can invest in something for 90 right now and earn 10 so that when you sell it you get
Vlad
20:06
you get a hundred,
Vlad
20:10
then you are going to be very happy to do that because that's going to let you not default later on.
Colleague
20:18
One thing is that we don't have partial repayment, we don't have interest.
Colleague
20:23
Because in real life, I would actually...
Vlad
20:25
Here the interest is not necessary. What is necessary is that you have an expectation that if you buy the debt now and sell it later,
Vlad
20:40
you are going to earn more. We just need capital gain. We don't need interest necessarily.
Colleague
20:46
Yeah, no, I was just thinking aloud that in real life I would consider
Colleague
20:51
The expected return of those $90.
Vlad
20:56
Mm-hmm.
Colleague
20:56
Is it better to partially repay my debt? But that's determined by interest, right? It's better to partially repay my debt and reduce interest on my debt.
Colleague
21:06
Or is it better to invest it and the risk adjusted returns are better than that?
Vlad
21:13
Yeah, so we said there is no way for you to repay anything before the maturity, right? You simply pay what you pay when you have to pay. Our system is simple.
Vlad
21:26
There is no interest, there is no flexibility in repayment, right? We want to play with it as simple of a system as possible. Why you still believe that if you bought an instrument
Vlad
21:39
you could earn more money in the future than you would have now is because
Vlad
21:50
two reasons. One is that if you buy an instrument now
Vlad
21:56
and you sell it later, you are buying it at an earlier time with regards to its own maturity.
Vlad
22:05
So if I buy a debt that is going to pay $100 in 10 days, if I buy it today, it is going to be more discounted than when I sell it three days before maturity. Because today there are 10 days to its maturity and then when I sell it there are three days to its maturity. If somebody is buying that at that point, they will be willing to pay more for it in principle.
Colleague
22:33
Yeah.
Vlad
22:33
Because it's less risk.
Colleague
22:35
So we have a pricing function that takes in time along with other stuff.
Vlad
22:39
Dealer, we don't have a pricing function besides the function. The dealer is our pricing function.
Colleague
22:45
So the agent looks at how much the dealer would pay.
Colleague
22:51
Now
Vlad
22:51
There
Colleague
22:52
versus in
Vlad
22:53
is another
Colleague
22:53
the future.
Vlad
22:54
reason in general with our dealer, which is that our dealer at the beginning of the simulation holds an amount of debt. Maybe he's going to buy more and some money and he's going to buy more debts in the meantime.
Vlad
23:15
Later on, what is going to be happening to our dealer is that the debt that he's holding is either going to be defaulted or repaid.
Vlad
23:29
If
Colleague
23:29
Yeah.
Vlad
23:30
the debt gets defaulted or repaid, in any case his inventory is going to involve more money and less debt claims.
Vlad
23:40
The more money and the less debt claims the dealer has, and this is how his pricing function works.
Vlad
23:48
The more he's willing to offer.
Vlad
23:52
The higher is the price that he's willing to pay on it.
Colleague
23:59
Right, because
Vlad
24:00
Right.
Colleague
24:00
he wants to spend his money, he wants to invest his money.
Vlad
24:03
He always wants to be in this
Colleague
24:04
showing me
Vlad
24:04
has equal value in debt and security. So for these two reasons,
Vlad
24:13
he will in principle be interested in
Vlad
24:18
He should be in principle interested in giving you more later on than he wants from you right now.
Colleague
24:30
Hmm.
Colleague
24:32
because he will have less
Colleague
24:35
a debt.
Colleague
24:36
So the dealer needs to be able to do this projection.
Colleague
24:41
And
Vlad
24:41
Yes,
Colleague
24:42
the agent needs to be able to
Colleague
24:47
predict what the dealer will do at different points in time to make this calculation.
Vlad
24:56
And we should keep things as simple as we can, right? So the point would be that simply our dealer, our agents
Vlad
25:06
is looking at
Vlad
25:09
not defaulting in the future.
Vlad
25:12
And he is going to always invest
Vlad
25:17
the money that he has
Vlad
25:22
in order not to default in the future. And in order to
Vlad
25:33
And as he does, he's going to buy stuff from the business.
Colleague
25:40
Yeah.
Vlad
25:43
And we have the dealer pricing things, which is the one part that we pretty much have how it works. And so the price would be set and he would buy. And then we basically have
Vlad
26:00
the hope of obviously the expectation of that agent to be able to earn enough.
Vlad
26:10
And that's either going to come true.
Vlad
26:13
Or not.
Vlad
26:14
That is going to come through in the case that things happen exactly as the agent predicts, but it's not going to come through if the particular kind of debt that he bought ends up facing a lot of defaults, right?
Colleague
26:31
Yeah.
Vlad
26:33
And things like that.
Colleague
26:38
Mm-hmm.
Colleague
26:39
Okay.
Colleague
26:43
So I get the general idea and then the devil will be in the details, right?
Vlad
26:51
Yes, so what I think could possibly be the first step
Colleague
26:58
to go in this direction would be to
Colleague
27:01
implement the dealer.
Vlad
27:05
Yes.
Colleague
27:05
Implement the pricing.
Colleague
27:09
the DS.
Colleague
27:10
And then.
Vlad
27:12
without even running the whole simulation or the interactions.
Colleague
27:16
to just make sure that the dealer works as intended.
Vlad
27:20
Yes.
Colleague
27:20
So we just create some scenarios and make sure that the pricing works as intended to validate this dealer.
Vlad
27:32
Yes, that sounds good.
Colleague
27:39
And I think you have the paper, which you already sent.
Vlad
27:44
Yes.
Colleague
27:54
The other thing is these classes of debt, right?
Colleague
27:59
Do we specify that?
Vlad
28:02
Yes, there is a piece that we need to figure out a little bit.
Colleague
28:09
I mean, maybe you decide to start
Colleague
28:14
Like you just decide that it's going to be ABC and then you define post hoc what that means for you or something.
Colleague
28:24
The other thing is that, in real life, the class of debt depends on the history and the credit worthiness of the person, but we don't have that.
Vlad
28:35
Everyone starts with no history.
Colleague
28:50
If this ends up being too complex, maybe you could even
Vlad
29:00
You could have a super simple thing where
Colleague
29:04
they can just
Colleague
29:07
get liquidity for their debt
Colleague
29:10
from the central bank or something.
Colleague
29:14
And it's just
Vlad
29:16
Getting liquidity.
Vlad
29:20
The problem is always how is that going to be priced, right? That is the main and that is the dealer function done by the bank or done by the dealer as we have it.
Vlad
29:36
The idea here could be maybe a simpler one to say that the dealer doesn't really have this multiple
Vlad
29:44
classes of debt.
Vlad
29:47
He simply treats all the debt equally.
Vlad
29:52
And then he basically prices the debt down if he sees defaults
Vlad
30:07
and up if he sees the repayments.
Vlad
30:15
Then beyond that, prices went down as he is
Vlad
30:23
buying a lot of it and prices it up as if he's selling a lot. That could be the simplest dealer. There will be no class of debt, there would simply be debt as it is.
Vlad
30:40
Those four things: default, repayments, and the demand and the supply
Vlad
30:49
movements that he's facing.
Colleague
30:53
Yeah, and then
Colleague
30:56
The price is basically the spread between the value of the debt and how much the dealer will give you for it.
Colleague
31:05
Is that the price?
Vlad
31:07
So the way that the dealer prices is basically looking at his own inventory size.
Colleague
31:14
Yeah, supply
Colleague
31:15
and demand, like you said.
Vlad
31:16
The dealer is basically the alternative to the supply-demand
Vlad
31:23
like the way that microeconomics thinks about pricing.
Colleague
31:28
But my question was more basic.
Colleague
31:30
How does price, what's the price of debt? What is it concretely? Is it the difference between, okay, you owe me 100
Colleague
31:41
and the dealer gives me 90 liquidity.
Colleague
31:44
Does that mean the price is 10?
Vlad
31:47
No, the price is not. The price is what the dealer gives you.
Colleague
31:50
Ah!
Vlad
31:52
Or what you give to the dealer if you're buying the debt from him.
Colleague
31:57
But it's going to be always lower, right?
Vlad
32:00
There are always two prices. The dealer always quotes two prices. There is never one price. These two prices are the price at which he's buying and the price at which he
Colleague
32:11
So, okay, so he's buying at 90.
Vlad
32:17
and he's selling at 95.
Colleague
32:20
All right. 95, okay.
Vlad
32:22
The debt that costs 100, like repays 100.
Colleague
32:26
Okay.
Vlad
32:28
So he moves. That's the main point of having the dealer involved.
Vlad
32:38
The dealer makes the debt liquid because he stands ready to sell it or buy it whenever the counterparties want, right?
Vlad
32:49
And he prices the liquidity of that, because there is the cash flow that you will receive when the debt is repaid, but the liquidity of that is priced based on the current situation
Vlad
33:05
in terms of how many other parties are willing to buy it and how many other parties are willing to sell it, right?
Vlad
33:15
And so he prices the liquidity and what is that? The price of liquidity ultimately is that spread between
Vlad
33:25
the price that he buys and the price that he sells.
Colleague
33:28
He's going to keep five and pocket that.
Vlad
33:31
He's going to pocket five or more or less. He's going to pocket five on a 95 or five on 85. That is basically telling you how liquid it ultimately is.
Vlad
33:47
So I think what we can do is maybe start with treating all debt the same.
Colleague
33:54
Mm-hmm.
Vlad
33:55
Treating all debt the same and then
Vlad
34:00
which is unrealistic in the sense that exactly the dealer
Vlad
34:08
could have certain brackets for this debt, right?
Vlad
34:15
But treating all debt the same.
Vlad
34:29
And then we see, right?
Vlad
34:32
The idea would be that if the dealer is in there, he should be able to
Vlad
34:38
make things better in terms of the defaults.
Colleague
34:43
Yeah, but first we need to, I think first we're going to simulate the dealer in a void and just give him inputs and outputs to make sure.
Vlad
34:52
how he works. Exactly.
Colleague
34:54
And the input will be
Colleague
34:56
somebody buying debt or somebody selling
Vlad
34:59
Can I give you a read a little bit to it? Is that okay?
Colleague
35:03
Yeah.
Colleague
35:06
But this will be what we
Colleague
35:11
put in and get. The input is somebody buying debt or selling debt from the dealer and then
Vlad
35:18
Every time this happens, all the prices will shift.
Vlad
35:22
Yeah.
Colleague
35:22
Because the equilibrium shifts. So we basically will have the dealer and we'll feed him different inputs and then we'll see how the prices vary.
Vlad
35:32
Whether he changes properly. So
Vlad
35:37
we can test that and then if that works how it should then we can try to make that input for the dealer.
Vlad
35:47
people from these counterparts in the market.
Vlad
35:52
Right, these agents we have around.
Vlad
35:55
That's all.
Colleague
35:55
Because in the month
Vlad
35:57
Yeah, in the market
Colleague
36:01
Like, the dealer is kind of passive. It doesn't initiate stuff.
Vlad
36:04
Exactly. He doesn't initiate stuff. And the point is that the way that they are going to initiate with him is also going to be automatic,
Colleague
36:13
Right?
Vlad
36:13
So we don't want them to have some specific risk appetite or anything like that. They're simply going to look at how much money they have and then they're going to buy the debt that they can buy.
Colleague
36:33
Yeah.
Vlad
36:45
So, can I give you a sense of how it works?
Vlad
36:50
And I can send this to you immediately.
Vlad
37:11
But this is this extremely simple dealer, right?
Vlad
37:20
There will be a little bit more addition because this here assumes a single type of debt or a single security. The point of the single security here is that the maturity of that debt is always the same, right?
Vlad
37:36
Counterparties are treated the same and then maturity is treated the same.
Vlad
37:43
We can keep the counterparty treatment as the same, but obviously our maturities cannot be the same, so we will need to introduce an additional function that is going to price
Colleague
37:49
Sure.
Vlad
37:49
That could kill our product.
Vlad
37:57
Still treating the debt as exactly the same, however it's going to treat shorter term debts.
Vlad
38:07
The size of the debt and the maturity is not the same for us. So we are going to come up with a function that is going to standardize the pricing.
Vlad
38:24
Standardize the pricing over maturities and sizes.
Colleague
38:32
And the less maturity, the better, right? Because there's less risk over time.
Vlad
38:39
Yeah, and what we can also do here is
Vlad
38:43
I think maybe that can help us. We can split the debt
Vlad
38:51
in standardized size.
Vlad
38:54
So we currently have IOU 100 Euro, the third person 50.
Colleague
38:59
Yeah.
Vlad
39:00
We can make it so that IOU ten times ten and you owe the other guy five times ten.
Colleague
39:08
Okay.
Vlad
39:09
So we are working with this small debt instruments
Vlad
39:14
which are all of equal status. They have different maturity, but they are of equal size.
Colleague
39:22
Yeah, and then you
Colleague
39:25
You factored out the size, it's out of the equation.
Vlad
39:28
Exactly. And so we don't have this problem where the dealer has some debt to sell, but it's a lot bigger piece and you might not have the money for the bigger piece, but you have money for a smaller piece. So we have a standard small piece, that is,
Colleague
39:47
Yeah.
Colleague
39:50
Like, yeah.
Vlad
39:53
Like a debt unit, it's kind of like a debt unit. So I owe you five debt units, you owe the other guy ten debt units and whatever.
Colleague
40:01
Yeah.
Vlad
40:05
So we simply have the difference in maturity and we are obviously ignoring the differences between counterparties, right? All the counterparties are treated as the same.
Colleague
40:16
Yeah.
Vlad
40:19
So we have this dealer that has a balance.
Vlad
40:25
In terms of A and B, and then what we need for him is a standard ticket size
Vlad
40:34
which is going to be the amount of trades. Wait.
Vlad
40:45
Let me start from the beginning.
Vlad
40:50
I will rewrite this for our purposes differently.
Vlad
41:11
Okay, let's read from the introduction number three: reconstruct a single security deal two-sided inside market to accommodate one ticket customer flow while laying off an outside venue formed by value-based traders
Vlad
41:31
at quotes B and A and plus or minus O half.
Vlad
41:40
There is no short-term borrowing, this doesn't really matter how it works. So there is an inventory for our dealer.
Vlad
41:51
And this inventory involves an amount of money and an amount of debt that he's holding currently,
Colleague
41:57
Yeah.
Vlad
41:57
Right? There is a
Vlad
42:05
The securities are A and cash is B.
Colleague
42:08
Hmm.
Vlad
42:14
And then we have
Vlad
42:18
outside spread so we need to have this value-based trader and he has a
Vlad
42:25
spread that he's setting up and there is a midpoint of that spread
Vlad
42:32
And then there is the standard ticket size, right? So this is going to be the standard size of trade.
Vlad
42:42
We did the other
Colleague
42:51
About ticket size, I don't get it.
Vlad
42:56
The ticket size is basically the
Vlad
43:04
So, the way this works is basically our dealer
Vlad
43:09
is going to be looking at his
Vlad
43:12
You can go to this page six if you want.
Colleague
43:15
I
Vlad
43:16
So
Colleague
43:17
No.
Vlad
43:17
On the visual ones.
Colleague
43:20
Okay, now I see.
Vlad
43:22
So if you look at this, the unit here is a ticket size, right?
Vlad
43:29
So let's imagine the dealer is at position two. This is a position where our dealer is
Vlad
43:38
going to have equal value in securities and in debts.
Vlad
43:46
Right, and ticket size is
Vlad
43:52
what key measures, right? So he says, I'm three ticket sizes away
Vlad
44:00
from running out of securities and three ticket sizes away from running out of money.
Colleague
44:09
Aww.
Vlad
44:10
Right, in the sense that there is a standard ticket size which means that over the next day, one trading day or one market
Vlad
44:26
activity sequence, I would move
Vlad
44:30
4-1
Vlad
44:33
in either direction, right? This is the standard.
Vlad
44:36
What kind would I move? I would move from two to three, for example, which is going to need me to price these securities lower because I have had, let's say, ten securities more that were sold to me than bought from me.
Vlad
45:00
So I got 100 securities sold to me and 90 securities bought from me. So now I'm finding myself at situation three, which is a situation where I ended up having ten more securities than I used to, which is my one ticket size.
Vlad
45:20
And that is how I set this up. I know how much standard daily movement would be and I also know how much I can take.
Vlad
45:33
I can take three ticket sizes. Right?
Colleague
45:38
No, I need maybe more time because I'm missing the basics, like ticket size and what the axes represent.
Colleague
45:50
I'm missing all the context, so you lost me.
Vlad
45:53
Do you want me to do it again?
Colleague
45:56
We can try, or I can try by myself.
Vlad
46:02
Let me try one more time. I teach this one all the time. Let me try it somewhere.
Colleague
46:08
You just say very simply what's a ticket size because that I don't know.
Vlad
46:13
It's the standard net movement over a trading sequence of the dealer inventory position day.
Colleague
46:22
What's the trading sequence? Is it how he...
Vlad
46:26
Let's say day. In our story, we have days, right?
Colleague
46:31
And every day we have the exact same change we assume that.
Vlad
46:35
No, no, no. We say the dealer has a standard ticket size, which is his expectation of how much he would usually lose within the day.
Colleague
46:51
Okay, and so in our model, we assume that.
Vlad
46:56
He kind of does the same amount of stuff every day.
Colleague
47:02
It's not that one day he does a million things and the next day he chills.
Vlad
47:05
It doesn't have to be the case that he is going to be having the standard ticket size. The idea would be that he just has a generally good understanding and typically the stuff moves within one ticket size.
Vlad
47:25
I mean, yeah, like we can also simplify that further. Instead of him estimating the standard ticket size, we could simply say there is an amount of how far the dealer is going to move.
Vlad
47:49
Willing to net sell or net buy over a day and that's it.
Vlad
47:55
And that's on the X axis.
Vlad
47:58
Yeah, the x-axis is the dealer's inventory. So the x-axis is such that if a dealer has, let's say, hundred dollars in securities and hundred dollars in money...
Colleague
48:11
How do you derive that from just seeing two?
Vlad
48:17
This is our representation using the ticket size, right? The point of it is that I'm taking the two because it is the middle.
Colleague
48:25
It corresponds to price zero.
Vlad
48:29
It corresponds to mid price zero and it's the middle, right?
Colleague
48:35
So what?
Vlad
48:35
The good thing is...
Colleague
48:38
Sorry, what is the y-axis?
Vlad
48:42
The y-axis is the price.
Colleague
48:45
And the price is...
Vlad
48:49
So the logic of this, if you want to understand the logic, is you need to understand why it puts the two and the zero price together.
Vlad
49:01
Whatever, call it zero price. But the point here is that the dealer says I have a balance sheet made out of money and securities.
Vlad
49:13
I have two values. One is the value of my security, the other is value of my money.
Vlad
49:19
What I want to determine, and I know, is externally set prices of the value-based trade.
Vlad
49:30
And I want to take the mid of my value-based trader, between the two prices that he sets for buying and selling.
Vlad
49:42
That is my midpoint when I am in the balanced inventory position where my balance sheet has equal amount of money and full amount of debt placed.
Vlad
49:55
So as I end up filling myself with securities or filling myself with money depending on what counterparties come to do with me, I'm going to be moving as I'm getting filled up with securities.
Vlad
50:13
Down to the right hand side up until I'm filled with securities and I will quote the lowest price.
Vlad
50:22
That I can just a moment before I run out of money.
Vlad
50:27
And so if I'm running out of securities here at the highest point at the left edge,
Vlad
50:36
I am at the point where I will quote the highest possible price just before I run out of security.
Vlad
50:48
That is going to make me do most trades.
Vlad
50:53
That I can be doing.
Colleague
50:55
I want to do as many because I basically make money from each trade.
Vlad
51:01
Exactly.
Colleague
51:01
The objective is to maximize the number of trades.
Vlad
51:05
Exactly. I am the market maker. I want to operate in this market and exploit my balance sheet to the maximum that I can so that I lay off to the value-based trader only at the point where I can't do any more trades because I have run out of the theme.
Colleague
51:26
Right. So here,
Colleague
51:28
we conventionally assume that the two is the midpoint and then
Colleague
51:34
If you move to the right,
Colleague
51:37
then you have more securities.
Colleague
51:40
If you move to the left,
Vlad
51:41
And you're working at a lower price,
Colleague
51:43
you move to the left.
Vlad
51:43
I don't think you may run out of security.
Vlad
51:48
You want to quote the exact price.
Vlad
51:53
The value-based trader is going to quote.
Vlad
51:58
Because you want to
Vlad
52:01
sell everything to
Vlad
52:03
sell as many as you can, right? But if you need to be buying,
Vlad
52:07
to a point where he only takes over where you can buy.
Vlad
52:16
You want to attract the customer
Vlad
52:19
right up until that point where you can't
Vlad
52:24
trade with a customer anymore.
Colleague
52:26
And why is the price negative?
Vlad
52:30
Don't worry, don't think of these prices as actual prices. Think of these as price corrections.
Colleague
52:37
Okay.
Vlad
52:38
Or the variations.
Colleague
52:40
Okay, now I get the idea. This is, yeah.
Vlad
52:45
Then the other thing is that you're going to have,
Vlad
52:49
you're going to quote two prices depending on the method that you are in.
Vlad
52:54
They are going to be equally removed from that median,
Vlad
52:59
such that the price at which you are buying
Vlad
53:02
is the lower one. You buy for a lower price and you sell at a higher price. And that is what you will be earning.
Colleague
53:12
Yeah, they have this, one is bid and then it's ask. So the ask is above, that's your, the arrow is what you're earning.
Vlad
53:23
Yeah.
Colleague
53:24
So basically this is a function where you input the dealer inventory and you get back
Colleague
53:32
the bid and the ask.
Vlad
53:35
Exactly. You input the dealer inventory, you input the value-based trader price.
Vlad
53:43
And you get the bid and the ask.
Vlad
53:45
And then you input the trades that the counterparties want to do with the dealer.
Vlad
53:53
Right?
Vlad
53:55
And then you understand where the dealer is moving and how is the price going to be moving.
Colleague
54:04
Yeah.
Vlad
54:05
That's
Colleague
54:06
the X, there's VBT anchors, but where is the X?
Colleague
54:12
Lower right and upper left.
Vlad
54:15
Yeah, it's the exact intersection between the higher and the mid and the lower.
Colleague
54:25
Yeah, and in our simulation how do we get the VBT, the VBT price?
Vlad
54:32
The VBT needs to be externally set and we need to see how we do that, right?
Vlad
54:39
Yeah, we need to see how we do this. The point is that the adjustments would be, I would say, three first adjustments that we need to make in terms of the model itself while we work on the dealer on the other side.
Vlad
54:52
They are to have more parties, number one. We can't have five parties because five is too little to think of a market. There are really only existing markets that are big enough, with constant movement in terms of buying and selling.
Vlad
55:10
In very liquid, very deep markets.
Colleague
55:14
Mm-hmm.
Vlad
55:15
And then we need to have the dealer. We need to give him an amount of money and securities, and he needs to have a bigger balance sheet than any of the traders.
Vlad
55:34
Then we need to have the value-based trader, and he has to have a big balance sheet as well.
Vlad
55:41
Where he also holds money and securities.
Vlad
55:52
So that will be the first step. The two of them need to be pretty big, both of them.
Colleague
56:00
Mm-hmm.
Vlad
56:05
We can simplify it as much as we want to. Maybe what we can do is set them up in such a way that all the entities,
Vlad
56:18
all the borrowers in our system or our normal entities,
Vlad
56:25
have an amount of debt towards some other entity in the ring.
Vlad
56:32
Let's say whatever amount they have, 50. They have five units of ten.
Vlad
56:38
And then we can say,
Vlad
56:41
they also have five towards the dealer and five towards the value-based trader.
Vlad
56:51
So the dealer and the value-based trader are on all of the plates, on all of the animals, right?
Colleague
57:02
Mm-hmm.
Vlad
57:03
And we can set them at the beginning to be in a balanced position. So given the amount of securities that they have,
Vlad
57:13
they are going to have an amount of money as well that's going to be equal, given the value of securities that they're going to be setting up.
Colleague
57:20
You mean they start in the middle at like two?
Vlad
57:24
Yes.
Vlad
57:30
And they need to be large, and the value-based trader ultimately needs to be extremely large. He needs to be in a position where he has a lot of securities. We can also see whether it's going to happen, and it would be a result where either one of them is getting swamped and cannot stay on.
Vlad
57:56
Can you deal with it?
Vlad
57:59
But generally they should be pretty large and they should not be getting in trouble very easily.
Vlad
58:06
Easier,
Vlad
58:08
because then ultimately the dealer should be in the position where he could hit the extreme, running out of either money or security.
Vlad
58:19
But the value-based trader should always be able to pick up.
Vlad
58:27
Yeah, got that.
Vlad
58:30
So this is the setup, right? This is the setup.
Colleague
58:37
Anyway, this whole thing of saying
Colleague
58:42
There's a lot of agents and each of them,
Colleague
58:47
the dealer gets five from each of them. That can be a second step.
Vlad
58:52
The first step, I would say, let's just
Colleague
58:55
have this dealer function.
Vlad
58:59
Yeah, I think what we
Colleague
59:01
means to get there is
Colleague
59:05
the VBT prices
Vlad
59:08
Mm-hmm.
Colleague
59:09
the function
Vlad
59:10
that you showed needs to be
Vlad
59:14
able to account for maturity.
Colleague
59:21
And then we need
Vlad
59:22
We need to define
Colleague
59:25
some toy inputs like
Colleague
59:28
Yeah, but I think, yeah, if you can
Vlad
59:33
fully specify the dealer function
Vlad
59:36
with these two things,
Vlad
59:39
then I can simulate the dealer function.
Vlad
59:45
Yeah,
Colleague
59:47
and then we can play with it.
Vlad
59:58
Right.
Vlad
59:59
Okay.
Vlad
01:00:02
Sounds good.
Colleague
01:00:20
These VBT
Vlad
01:00:20
Oh
Colleague
01:00:20
prices, we're going to hard code them.
Vlad
01:00:24
Yeah, I mean we need to see. I'm up for hard coding them as long as we can do it in a reasonable manner.
Vlad
01:00:34
We need to set it up in such a way.
Vlad
01:00:38
I think we should cut. The point of them, the other story is that they are external.
Vlad
01:00:45
The idea in theory is that the dealer prices liquidity, the VBT prices credit.
Vlad
01:00:59
Right? Because the VBT ends up holding the security long.
Vlad
01:01:04
So often he hits the maturity on the security.
Vlad
01:01:12
He is interested in
Vlad
01:01:15
not being defaulted.
Vlad
01:01:21
So what we can say is maybe there is some kind of starting point. I can work with GPT to figure out what would be a reasonable
Vlad
01:01:35
initial price that he could be setting.
Vlad
01:01:42
And then we could say he can adjust it
Vlad
01:01:46
based on the
Vlad
01:01:49
default.
Vlad
01:01:57
And then for the maturity accounting, that's the other bit, right? That's the other bit.
Vlad
01:02:08
That's going to be harder because the debt is not on the same
Colleague
01:02:16
No, but you said we're going to make it into equal slices.
Vlad
01:02:21
Equal slices in terms of the cash flow, but in terms of the maturity...
Colleague
01:02:25
The maturity will be the only thing that
Vlad
01:02:29
is the legal. So maybe that defines the baskets.
Colleague
01:02:34
That can be the ABC thing. Maybe you don't want to fragment it on every possible maturity.
Colleague
01:02:44
But maybe you want to put, I don't know, one.
Vlad
01:02:46
Like short, medium and long.
Vlad
01:02:50
My trade is
Colleague
01:02:52
Yeah, I mean we will still have all the different maturities, but in terms of pricing it will be in buckets.
Colleague
01:03:02
I don't know.
Vlad
01:03:10
I mean, I feel like the point here is
Vlad
01:03:17
Yeah,
Vlad
01:03:19
Yeah, I think we probably have to have the buckets.
Vlad
01:03:29
Yeah.
Vlad
01:03:37
And then there needs to be a way in which
Vlad
01:03:45
Let me think about it.
Colleague
01:03:46
Sure.
Vlad
01:03:50
Okay, so let me try to think about it this week and get back to you.
Vlad
01:03:57
And then
Vlad
01:03:59
Let's try to do it.
Vlad
01:04:02
The price to the dealer on its own, it works.
Colleague
01:04:05
Mm-hmm.
Vlad
01:04:06
And then put them into the simulation.
Vlad
01:04:17
All right.
Vlad
01:04:20
I'll get back to you.
Vlad
01:04:23
By Friday, I'll have something that we can talk about if you get done.
Colleague
01:04:26
Mm-hmm.
Colleague
01:04:29
For new.
Vlad
01:04:31
Are you going to text the people?
Colleague
01:04:34
Yeah, so I saw my friend yesterday and he's like, I'm the bottleneck.
Colleague
01:04:40
Because I'm supposed to design a case study for you, but I've been busy doing other stuff.
Colleague
01:04:48
And then I was like, so you don't have anyone else in the pipeline and you're just taking your time. So yeah, we don't have anyone else.
Vlad
01:04:55
So that's good.
Colleague
01:04:56
Yeah, and honestly, I'm fine with it taking time. I'm not in a hurry.
Vlad
01:05:01
Right.
Colleague
01:05:01
Because meanwhile I can work with you, I can do the German stuff, right?
Colleague
01:05:08
So just...
Vlad
01:05:08
You'll be here if most of the things are clear from your schedule by the time you...
Vlad
01:05:14
Exactly. And he was like, what I'm preparing is that today...
Colleague
01:05:19
Basically, we have this game where I'm arguing for Alibaba stock.
Colleague
01:05:25
Because he's on China and he knows a lot about China, which is very cool. And everyone else tries to demolish my thesis.
Colleague
01:05:36
And I was like, okay, that sounds fun. He's like, no, it's more like a rectal exam. Everyone's trying to fuck you.
Vlad
01:05:44
But it's really interesting because he really studied China a lot, so he knew a lot of the stuff that I experienced.
Vlad
01:05:52
What did he do in his life?
Colleague
01:05:55
These guys, he's a financial analyst, right?
Vlad
01:05:59
Okay.
Colleague
01:06:00
But he's very technical, like he codes a lot and he works with AI a lot.
Colleague
01:06:05
He gets AI very deeply.
Colleague
01:06:09
And then he goes really deep into these companies, right?
Colleague
01:06:14
So he's really good.
Vlad
01:06:19
He's the one I told you interviewed with the...
Colleague
01:06:23
Leo Baldassio Brenna.
Vlad
01:06:25
Right.
Vlad
01:06:30
Then where did he study?
Colleague
01:06:32
So he studied in...
Colleague
01:06:37
He studied in India.
Vlad
01:06:40
Bachelors of Science in Physics.
Colleague
01:06:44
He got a master's in physics in Frankfurt University.
Vlad
01:06:49
Mm-hmm.
Colleague
01:06:50
And then he did a master's in finance in Frankfurt.
Vlad
01:06:54
In the House of Finance.
Colleague
01:06:57
Frankfurt School of Finance and Management.
Vlad
01:07:02
Okay. And then he became a data scientist.
Colleague
01:07:07
In a couple banks.
Colleague
01:07:10
And then he became a quantitative analyst at this big capital fund in Berlin.
Vlad
01:07:19
Wow.
Colleague
01:07:22
If you come to Berlin, you can meet him.
Vlad
01:07:26
I would love to. Yeah.
Vlad
01:07:29
Let's see what is going to be next. How was with Jake?
Colleague
01:07:33
It was great.
Colleague
01:07:36
We drank too much.
Vlad
01:07:37
How does he seem to...
Vlad
01:07:41
He seems good, he started a PhD.
Vlad
01:07:45
Yes, yes, I know, yes.
Colleague
01:07:48
And he has the child.
Colleague
01:07:52
He has the home so he's obviously very busy, right?
Vlad
01:07:59
Yeah. I want to talk to him. I haven't talked to him for a long time. Today's his birthday. I'm going to send him a message.
Colleague
01:08:05
Shit, it's true. He told me. Yeah, I'm gonna send him too.
Colleague
01:08:13
Yeah, I also didn't talk to him for months because he was so busy.
Vlad
01:08:17
Yeah, I haven't also talked to him.
Vlad
01:08:23
We work closely but yeah, I'll talk to you, let's see how it is.
Vlad
01:08:32
Okay, I'm going to go do more stuff.
Vlad
01:08:35
And I'll try to get something for you relatively soon.
Colleague
01:08:40
Okay.
Vlad
01:08:40
And we can try rolling this out if we can. It will be amazing.
Vlad
01:08:48
If you get all it out.
Vlad
01:08:54
Because what I want to do for these presentations is basically to present our simulation and if I can do these additions to it and also show like a dealer.
Vlad
01:09:03
Also show like a band.
Vlad
01:09:06
Will be major.
Vlad
01:09:09
Or like mid-December.
Colleague
01:09:10
Mid-December.
Vlad
01:09:13
We can certainly have progress, right? Let's see how far we get.
Vlad
01:09:18
Yeah, let's see how far we get. Yeah, of course.
Vlad
01:09:21
I think if we could once we nail these two...
Vlad
01:09:26
Then besides the risk, expense and all the stuff that goes with it, we are in a really good spot, right? That's the only major kind of thing.
Colleague
01:09:44
Okay, cool.
Vlad
01:09:47
Yeah, let's do it. I think it's anyway going to be publishable before that but once we have those things...
Vlad
01:09:58
I think ultimately each of these is going to be its own paper, right?
Vlad
01:10:02
There will be a single paper, kind of basic paper on what you already have, maybe improve the base. And then there are going to be these papers that add these to each of them.
Vlad
01:10:15
Right. And so we can have a final paper that says all the pieces apply to the decision making.
Vlad
01:10:23
And that's it.
Vlad
01:10:28
Hopefully.
Vlad
01:10:37
Okay, but I...
Colleague
01:10:38
All right,
Vlad
01:10:38
Hope you get to sit down soon in your life.
Colleague
01:10:41
Hope so too. Okay, say hi to your mom, to Sally.
Vlad
01:10:48
Say hi to her if you talk to her.
Colleague
01:10:50
Okay.
Vlad
01:10:53
Ciao.
Colleague
01:10:53
Ciao, have a good evening.
