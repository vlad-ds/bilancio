### 1) Cash‑for‑goods (chair) — immediate settlement

**Reference:** *1. Balance sheet analysis of a transaction*, Exercise **5**, **p. 1–2**.
**Scenario:** A **Firm** sells a **chair** to a **Household** for **cash** with immediate delivery and payment. Initial state: Firm holds the chair; Household holds cash of equal value. Event at t₁: chair leaves Firm’s assets; cash enters Firm’s assets; Household receives the chair and gives up cash. End state: Firm holds cash; Household holds the chair; no promises outstanding.&#x20;

### 2) Two firms, cash purchase of goods — immediate settlement (100–100 example)

**Reference:** *1. Balance sheet analysis of a transaction*, Exercise **10**, **p. 3**.
**Scenario:** **Firm 1** uses **cash** to buy **goods** worth **100** from **Firm 2**. Initial state: F1 has cash 100; F2 has goods 100. Event: F1 gives up cash and gains goods; F2 gives up goods and gains cash. End state: F1 owns goods 100; F2 owns cash 100.&#x20;

### 3) IOU swap with third party before maturity (assignment of claim)

**Reference:** *2. Issuance of promises*, Exercise **4**, **p. 5–6**.
**Scenario:** At T₀ **F1** holds **goods**, **F2** holds **cash**, **F3** holds **services**; all equal value. At T₁ F1 and F2 **exchange promises**: F1 promises to deliver goods at T₃; F2 promises to pay cash at T₃. At T₂, before maturity, **F1 assigns its claim on F2** to **F3** in exchange for services (claim’s payee changes to F3). At T₃, F1 delivers goods to F2; F2 pays cash to **F3**; all claims/liabilities are extinguished. End state: F1 holds services, F2 holds goods, F3 holds cash.

### 4) Generic claim transfer to a third party (no services/goods specified)

**Reference:** *2. Issuance of promises*, Exercise **9**, **p. 7**.
**Scenario:** **Firm 1** holds a **claim** on **Firm 2** (promise to pay later). F1 transfers that claim to **Firm 3** in exchange for another asset (e.g., cash or services). F3 now holds the claim on F2; F2’s obligation is unchanged; F1 records the new asset received and removes the claim.&#x20;

---

### 5) Deferred exchange with simultaneous maturity (household–firm)

**Reference:** *3. Risk related*, Exercise **1** (second part), **p. 8–9**.
**Scenario:** A **Firm** and a **Household** agree to **deliver the chair and pay cash at the same future time t₂**. At t₁ they create matching promises/claims; at t₂ the **delivery** and **payment** occur and both promises are canceled. End state: Firm holds cash; Household holds the chair.&#x20;

### 6) Goods now, cash later (two firms, different times)

**Reference:** *3. Risk related*, Exercise **2**, **p. 9**.
**Scenario:** **Firm 2** transfers **goods** at **t₁** to **Firm 1**; **Firm 1** promises to **pay at t₂**. At t₂ payment is made and the promise/claim is extinguished. This staggers delivery and funding, capturing bargaining power asymmetry.&#x20;

### 7) One party pays now, the other promises later (asymmetric timing)

**Reference:** *3. Risk related*, Exercise **3**, **p. 8**.
**Scenario:** Two **Firms** transact **goods-for-cash** such that **one side compensates immediately** while **the counterparty promises to compensate later** (e.g., cash now, goods later, or vice versa). Settlement at maturity extinguishes the deferred side’s liability and the holder’s claim.&#x20;

### 8) Funding‑liquidity stress leading to asset sale or default (with default claim)

**Reference:** *3. Risk related*, Exercise **4**, **p. 10**.
**Scenario:** A **Household** must **pay 100** at **t₃** but has **cash 70** plus assets (**apple 30**, **chair 100**). At **t₂.₂** the household first tries to sell the **apple** for **30**; if that fails, it may sell the **chair** for **100**; if neither sale succeeds, it **pays 70** and **defaults for 30**, creating a **default liability** (household) and **default claim** (firm). The default can be resolved by delivering the apple valued at 30 or by court‑ordered liquidation up to 30.&#x20;

### 9) Production financed by **bond** — break‑even

**Reference:** *4. Introduction to credit*, Exercise **1a**, **p. 12–13**.
**Scenario:** **Firm A** issues a **bond** to an **Investor** to fund purchase of **resources** from **Firm B**; produces and sells output; generates revenue sufficient to repay **principal + interest** exactly. End state: Investor repaid; no default; Firm A retains no financing liability.&#x20;

### 10) Production financed by **bond** — loss (default)

**Reference:** *4. Introduction to credit*, Exercise **2a**, **p. 12–13**.
**Scenario:** Same as above but sales revenue is **insufficient**; at maturity Firm A **cannot repay in full** and issues a **default liability**; Investor holds a **default claim** reflecting missed repayment.&#x20;

### 11) Production financed by **equity (stock)** — break‑even

**Reference:** *4. Introduction to credit*, Exercise **1b**, **p. 12–13**.
**Scenario:** **Equity** is issued to fund the resource purchase and production. At break‑even, there is no creditor repayment; returns accrue to shareholders via value retained, with no debt claim outstanding.&#x20;

### 12) Production financed by **equity (stock)** — loss

**Reference:** *4. Introduction to credit*, Exercise **2b**, **p. 12–13**.
**Scenario:** Revenue is below cost; there is **no default liability** (no debt). Loss is borne by **stockholders** as a **capital loss** (equity value reduction).&#x20;

### 13) Production financed by **bank loan** — break‑even

**Reference:** *4. Introduction to credit*, Exercise **1c**, **p. 12–13**.
**Scenario:** **Bank** extends a **loan** (creating a **deposit**) to **Firm A** to buy resources from **Firm B**; Firm A produces, sells, and repays **principal + interest** in full; bank assets/liabilities shrink accordingly.&#x20;

### 14) Production financed by **bank loan** — loss (default)

**Reference:** *4. Introduction to credit*, Exercise **2c**, **p. 12–13**.
**Scenario:** Firm A’s revenue is insufficient to repay; a **default liability** is recognized on Firm A and a **default claim** on the bank; follow‑on resolution depends on asset liquidation/bankruptcy.&#x20;

### 15) Bond loss resolved via **asset liquidation** (repayment continues)

**Reference:** *4. Introduction to credit*, Exercise **2** (first branch), **p. 14**.
**Scenario:** After a **bond‑financed** production **loss**, Firm A **liquidates other assets** at a high enough price to **repay the lender fully** and continue operating.&#x20;

### 16) Bond loss resolved via **bankruptcy** (court liquidation)

**Reference:** *4. Introduction to credit*, Exercise **2** (second branch), **p. 14**.
**Scenario:** If asset sale proceeds are **insufficient**, Firm A **declares bankruptcy**; a court liquidates assets; the **lender recovers up to the remaining amount**, often taking a loss.&#x20;

### 17) Two‑firm **IOU‑for‑resources** with post‑production loss and **refinancing need**

**Reference:** *4. Introduction to credit*, Exercise **3**, **p. 11–12**.
**Scenario:** **Firms exchange promises**: one delivers **resources** now, the other promises **cash later**. After production, the receiving firm incurs a **loss** and must find **liquidity to repay** (via issuing a **bond**, **equity**, or taking a **bank loan**); settlement or default follows depending on chosen financing and realized cash.&#x20;

### 18) **Secondary‑market bond sale** — early sale before production (profit to seller)

**Reference:** *4. Introduction to credit*, Exercise **4** (early), **p. 15**.
**Scenario:** **Investor 1** sells the **bond early** (before production) to **Investor 2** at a price yielding **profit** to Investor 1; later the borrower **defaults**, leaving **Investor 2** holding a **default claim**.&#x20;

### 19) **Secondary‑market bond sale** — late sale after production (break‑even to seller)

**Reference:** *4. Introduction to credit*, Exercise **4** (late), **p. 15**.
**Scenario:** **Investor 1** sells the **bond late** (after production/sales) near face value (seller roughly **breaks even**); the borrower still **defaults** later, leaving **Investor 2** with a **default claim**.&#x20;

### 20) Two‑household retail purchases across two banks with **RRR = 10%**

**Reference:** *5. Monetary policy*, Exercise **1**, **p. 16–17**.
**Scenario:** **Household 1 @ Bank 1 buys a boat**; **Household 2 @ Bank 2 buys a car**. **Interbank intraday claims clear first**, then banks must meet **required reserve ratio (RRR) 10%**. The scenario tracks **client payments**, **interbank settlement**, and **post‑clearing reserve adjustments**; feasibility depends on **interest rate conditions** consistent with reserve funding.&#x20;

### 21) Same as #20 with **RRR = 25%**

**Reference:** *5. Monetary policy*, Exercise **2**, **p. 16–17**.
**Scenario:** Identical purchases and sequencing (**intraday interbank clearing → RRR check**) but with **RRR 25%**, affecting banks’ **reserve needs**, potential **funding** (e.g., central‑bank borrowing), and **pricing/interest conditions** for the transaction to complete.&#x20;

### 22) Same as #20 with **RRR = 50%**

**Reference:** *5. Monetary policy*, Exercise **3**, **p. 16–17**.
**Scenario:** Same retail purchases with **RRR 50%**; analyze whether interbank positions and reserve funding allow settlement, and what **interest‑rate environment** must hold for feasibility.&#x20;
