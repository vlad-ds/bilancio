"""
Bridge between main Bilancio system and dealer module.

This module provides conversion functions between the main system's Payable
contracts and the dealer module's Ticket instruments. It enables:

- Converting Payable contracts to tradeable Tickets
- Mapping ticket ownership back to Payable holders
- Applying trade results to update contract ownership

The bridge maintains consistency between the two representations while keeping
the systems decoupled.
