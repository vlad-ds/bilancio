"""
L1 dealer pricing kernel.

This module implements the core L1 dealer pricing formulas from Section 8
of the specification. It computes all derived dealer quantities from the
current inventory and VBT anchor prices.

The kernel is the mathematical heart of the dealer system, computing:
- Capacity: Maximum fundable buy tickets (K*, X*)
- Layoff probability: Risk-neutral hedging probability (λ)
- Inside width: Competitive equilibrium spread (I)
- Midline: Inventory-sensitive mid price p(x)
- Clipped quotes: Final bid/ask quotes b_c(x), a_c(x)

All arithmetic uses Decimal for precision - never float.

    Recompute all derived dealer quantities from current (inventory, cash).

    This is the core L1 kernel from specification Section 8. It updates

    - VBT anchor prices M, O (and derived A, B)
    - Ticket size S

    The kernel implements the complete pricing formula hierarchy:
    1. Compute current inventory (a, x)
    2. Check guard regime (M <= M_MIN) and pin if needed
    3. Compute capacity (K*, X*) and ladder parameters (N, λ)
    4. Compute inside width (I) from layoff probability

    6. Compute interior quotes a(x), b(x)
    7. Clip to outside bounds and detect pins
