"""
Trade execution logic for the dealer ring.

This module implements the TradeExecutor class, which handles customer trades
with dealers in the dealer ring model. It implements:

- Event 1: Customer SELL (interior) - Customer sells ticket to dealer
- Event 2: Customer BUY (interior) - Customer buys ticket from dealer
- Event 9: Customer SELL (passthrough) - Routed to VBT at outside bid B
- Event 10: Customer BUY (passthrough) - Routed to VBT at outside ask A

The executor determines whether trades can be executed by the dealer (interior)
or must be routed to the VBT (passthrough), executes balance sheet updates,
and enforces programmatic assertions C1, C3, and C4.

All arithmetic uses Decimal for precision - never float.
