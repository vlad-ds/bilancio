"""
Pricing kernel for Banks-as-Dealers.

Implements the Treynor-style dealer pricing from Section 6 of the specification.

The bank earns reserves by taking liquidity risk. Over horizon H=10 days,
liquidity risk is the chance that reserve outflows exceed inflows, forcing
end-of-day CB borrowing at cost i_B.

The bank sets rates only (r_D, r_L) and updates them ticket-by-ticket.
The corridor and backstop discipline prices and guarantee settlement.
