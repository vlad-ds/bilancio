Reserve projection and cash-tightness calculation.

Implements the 10-day reserve path projection from Section 6.1.3 of the specification.

The Treasury desk builds a full 10-day reserve trajectory R̂(h) for h ∈ {t, ..., t+10}
after each ticket event, combining:
1. Current balance sheet
2. Scheduled central-bank and loan legs
3. Remaining expected withdrawals for today
