    Market maker agent for a maturity bucket in the dealer ring.

    Dealers provide two-sided markets (bid/ask) for claims within their
    assigned maturity bucket. They maintain inventory and cash positions,
    adjusting quotes based on inventory levels via the kernel formula.

    Attributes inherited from Agent:
        id: Unique identifier (e.g., "dealer_short", "dealer_mid")
        name: Display name (e.g., "Dealer (short)")
        kind: Always "dealer"
        asset_ids: Claims owned (bought from sellers)
        liability_ids: Currently unused for dealers
        stock_ids: Currently unused for dealers
        defaulted: Whether dealer has failed

    Note:
        The detailed trading state (inventory list, quotes, cash) is
        maintained in DealerState within the dealer subsystem. This
        Agent class provides the main system representation for
        ownership tracking during claim transfers.
