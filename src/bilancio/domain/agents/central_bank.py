    The CB issues two types of liabilities:
    1. Cash - bearer liability, can be held by anyone
    2. ReserveDeposit - deposit liability, held by banks/treasury

    The CB also has a lending facility for banks:
    - CBLoan - asset of CB, liability of borrowing bank

    The corridor is defined by two rates:
    - reserve_remuneration_rate (floor, i_R): what banks earn on reserves
    - cb_lending_rate (ceiling, i_B): what banks pay when borrowing

    Both are 2-day effective rates as per the Banks-as-Dealers specification.
